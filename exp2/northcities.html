Askelion, Jewel of the Winter's Blood Glacier, is formed out of the living ice itself, a technological and magical marvel to rival the Angel Cities, Drazzahezz or immense Vorn itself. Wide corridors make their way through the ice, magical runes keeping the heat from the Ilarn's bodies from melting their city around them. Great squares open up, forming natural places of the people to gather and trade for goods, be it Ice Berries from the frozen slopes, hides and furs from the great shaggy beasts that roam the Northland or weapons and armour for defence against the neverending hordes of Woken Dead. Clever switchbacks and spirals in the passages cut out the chill winds outside the city, keeping it warm within, the great weight of all that ice keeping the temperature pleasently temperate.
<br><br>
Deep within the city itself, far below the living quarters and the markets of the Ilarn, is the Mani Stone Mines, that never ending supply of power for the Ilarns weapons, technology and magic. Without it, the city would crash to a halt as the very walls themselves begin to melt and collapse, and the Ilarn themselves would freeze to death on the lethal slopes of the glacier.

Created by the Magus Council only a handful of years ago, Morban is mostly unknown to the general population. Indeed there are very few people living here, as it is effectively a glorified Jump Gate Community. However, it does represent one of only two solid beacons of light in the otherwise chill and bitter Northland. Casters from almost every Sect live and work there, each doing their jobs in what might be viewed as a miniaturisation of how the rest of Tal'Vorn works. Fire Mages keep the community warm as Guardian Casters protect the inhabitents and Order Sect members keep the peace, even as Earth Sect Wizards construct new buildings from the very bedrock underfoot.
