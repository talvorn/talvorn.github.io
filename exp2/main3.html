Welcome to the North<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the second expansion for Tal'Vorn, the North. Using the information presented here, you will be able to create one of multiple new, and powerful Races, each hinted at in the histories of Tal'Vorn but not, until now, revealed. These include the body-borrowing Mortis, the rotting Accurséd and the phase-shifting Ilarn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also included is new information on the types of abilities these groups have access to and the places in which they live. Not only that, but with the release of this expansion, even more types of Magic become available to you, the role-player, including the Ilarn's powerful Phase Magic and the Mortis' necromantic Bone Magic.<br>
<br>
<br>
The North is a savage and dangerous place, populated by many creatures unseen in the rest of Tal'Vorn, but, perhaps what makes it so very dangerous is the presence of the Woken Dead. These living dead monstrosities have been slowly appearing all across Tal'Vorn and it is in the North that they are the strongest, pushed on by the Accurséd or certain dark-willed Mortis. You as a player will now be able to battle these horrors or even, if you are powerful enough, command some Woken Dead minons of your own.</br>
