Devloped many years ago by the Ilarn to take advantage of their natural abilities, if having tiny micromechanisms in your blood streams can be termed natural, Phasing Magic allows the Ilarn to shift in and out of existance. At its most basic it allows them to dodge physical attacks, though this isn't by any means the only ability of this Magic. Simply put, it allows the Ilarn to move things in and out of the dimensions above and below our own, thus making them more or less 'real'. Of course, this 'real' is subjective, but the objective results are without question.

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Phase Magic is a method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield. However, Phase Magic is not a Magus Council approved spell group, and never was. As such any of it's spells contained within the Magus Council facilities are there purely for purposes of research.


</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Dysjunction</b><br>
<i>Summoning great magical energies and gesturing violently towards the target, the Phase Magic user forces the victim out of the dimension, and indeed the surrounding dimensions, so far beyond the 'reality' that they can never return. Although it might not kill them, depending on the dimension they end up in, this is very likely and it is absolutely certain that they won't be bothering the Caster ever again.</i><br></li>

<li> <b>True Blade</b><br>

<i>Forcing all their power into their weapon, the Phase Magic Caster can strike, making their weapon one of the very sharpest things in all existance. They do this by spreading it across multiple dimensions, until they find one where their target is the most weak against their weapon. Although the spell is short lived, typically only one or two blows, it does allow the Phase Magic user to literally carve through a mountain, let alone armour and magical defenses.</i></li></ul>

<b><i><font size="4">Magic Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
Phase Magic has no real associations with any other form of Magic, having simply not come into contact with the Sects of the East, let alone the Magics of the West. However, the Casters do tend to get on well with those Mortis who follow Zarner's commands, as even the Ilarn have something to fear from the Woken Dead that roam the Winter's Blood glaciers slopes. However, they do not suffer the users of Accurséd Magic to live, casting them down whenever they are able and thus, by association with the God Killar and the Goddess Illaria, have no desire to have anything to do with Dark or Blood Magic.<br>

<br>
The Symbol of Phase Magic is the Shimmering Blade.<br>
<br>
The most powerful Phase Magic user currently alive is Helbren Moraren.<br>
