ShadowMetal is forged by Accurs√©d in the blood of the Ilarn. It acts as steel in everyway, bar one. Phasing Magic has no effect on it. This is due to the metal being impregnated with the micromachines in the blood of all Ilarn.

ShadowMetal is typically a bloody red colour, in spite of its name, and is substantially more expansive, due to the unique nature of it's tempering liquid, then a standard steel weapon. As such, the weapons are just as rare as a plasteel weapon, though is not even close to being of the same strength or flexability.
