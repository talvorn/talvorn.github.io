Though there is more to the Northland then simply the great Glacier, the majority of it is featureless tundra and mountains. Indeed both cities of the North, Askelion and the Eastern colony, Morban are built within its immediate vicinity. 
The Glacier springs from the very pole itself, that unimaginably cold, frozen wasteland, where nothing lives, and where even Ice Sect Casters cannot survive. Indeed, even White Dragons do not venture this far north and they live off the very snow itself for much of the time.

Filled with rock and ice and chunks of Mani Crystal, the Glacier has been flowing since before the Gods came to Tal'Vorn. It is  for this reason that only the second half contains any Mani Crystal, though this doesn't stop the inhabitents of Morban scouting out its lower slopes in search of this rare substance.
