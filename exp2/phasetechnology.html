The Phase Technology of the Ilarn is a strange thing, almost an alchemy. The potions they develop for healing work through technological means on their users, rather then magical and the strange devices that emerge from their workshops rival some of the weirdest things that the Research Sect has ever come up with. Below is a list of various items that they have come up with. Of course, this list is not exhaustive.
<br><br>
1. Phasing Draught - A quick drink of this liquid allows the user to temporarily walk through walls.
<br><br>
2. Blade Oil - This oil, when applies to a weapon, doubles its ability to pierce armour.
<br><br>
3. Instant Translocation Device - This device instantly transports you to any point within one mile. Unfortunately the control mechanism isn't quite correct yet, so when we say any point, we do mean that . . .
