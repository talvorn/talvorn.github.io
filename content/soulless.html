This is the paradox of the Soulless. Obey their
God and die a final death, disobey and die a final
death. There is no incentive, no drive other then
faith, other then a sense of thanks for having life
in the first place, for being given the chance to
draw breath and walk upon Tal'Vorn. And for all
too many of the Soulless, for too many of Hevar's
children, this is simply not enough. They desire
more, more power, more life, more existence, and
yet they cannot have it. And so some of these
Soulless, some of these children, betray their
father and scream their hatred for the living, for
the souled, into the night.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Physical Description:</b> The Soulless are a mixed
group, some of them eight foot behemoths,
mountains of muscle and brutality, crafted with
sheer destruction for most in mind, resilience and
toughness highly important, with intelligence
coming further down the list. They tend to be
heavily built, long armed and short legged, their
muscles bulging from their flesh, piggy eyes
glaring around them. And yet others are short,
gangly creatures, highly intelligent and well
suited for controlling the flow of Mani, the very
energy sparking from their finger tips as they
move and talk. Yet there is a third group, the most
unique and rare, that combine both elements,
strength and skill, intelligence and brutality, into a
being that looks so much like humanity that the
only way to tell the Race and the Invader Humans
apart is the bloody red or pitch black orbs of the
Soulless. Indeed, they are so similar that it is
possible to cross breed between Humanity and
this third breed of Soulless, though the male
children are always human, the female are
invariably marked with the pitchy eyes or bloody
orbs of the Soulless This last group are by far the most common, and it is these that described in the rest of this text.
The Soulless have no soul, as their name
implies, and, having been solely crafted to fight
against the soul-drinking Mist Devils, have no
other purpose in existence. Hevar the NightBringer intended to craft a Race of fighters
and of mages that would be able to destroy the
Mist Devils and thus preserve the other Races
from the Dark Gods assault. Yet Hevar had not
accounted for the self-awareness of His creations.
Though they had no soul, the Soulless where well
aware of just who and what their were and,
worse, they were also fully aware of what Hevar
would do with them once they had completed the
task they had been born for. They would be
destroyed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Personality:</b> Soulless tend to be a grim and
brooding Race. They very lack of a soul, whilst
not effecting their day to day lives, hangs over
them like a poised sword. They throw themselves
into everything they do to try and distract their
minds and savour every moment of existence.
This seems to come and go in bouts of mania
followed by pits of sloth and depression, where
many Soulless simply fail to see the point of
getting up in the morning. However, as a
majority, the Race is ferocious in its attempts to
do good and keep to the word of Hevar, making
the Soulless a powerful force for good on
Tal'Vorn.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Religion:</b> The majority of Soulless completely
fail to see the point of worshipping Hevar. The
God didn't give them souls, why would he answer
their prayers now? However some believe in the
God of Justice fiercely, believing that if they do
well enough in their lives that the NightBringer
will grant them another chance. Not a soul, but
simply another lifetime to enjoy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Relations:</b> Soulless, in spite of their typically dim
outlook on life, actually get on well with most of
the Races. DragonLords can sometimes be an
issue, due to Soulless-Born resembling Humans
very closely, but this is typically minor in
comparison to most of the other Races squabbles.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Territory:</b> The Soulless, like a lot of the smaller
Races in Tal'Vorn, are happy to live in the cities
of the other Races, especially those of the
Humans, as the Soulless-Born find it much easier
to fade into the background there. As such,
Soulless are actually much more uncommon in
the more out of the way places on Tal'Vorn, such
as isolated Jump Gate Communities.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Language:</b> The Soulless, being made out of
human stock, have never had a need for a
language of their own and have never devised
one. They came into a world already teeming
with life and culture, and simply adopted much of
it as their own. As such they all speak Common.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Names:</b> Soulless naming conventions are effected
by their cosmopolitan natures. As such they
typically takes names common to the cities and
areas they were born in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Hevar is my God and Ievar is our enemy! Death to the Deathless! Kill the Mist Devils!</i><br>
Anon<br>
<br>
<i>Fools! You would come here and try to stop me? You could not even
comprehend the strength I have, the power that fills my limbs! Hevar is
a false God! A liar and cheat who would not even grant His children
souls! Well now I have a Soul! I am a Soulless no longer! I serve Ievar
and I will crush you all in the Corrupters name!</i><br>
Last words a rogue Soulless before he was destroyed by an Order taskforce.
