Formed from a single piece of stone, Solgaran is a beauty to behold, magnificent and awe-inspiring. Even for those who do not worship Solar it is said to be a moving sight. Almost a mile wide at it's base, the tower reaches out towards the sun like an almighty finger, it's razor-sharp tip more then three miles above the surface. This makes it the tallest freestanding structure on the planet. Around the tower is clustered the largest of the Anvar fortress-temples, Islara, named after the Island itself. <br>
<br>
The population of Islara is almost exclusively Anvar and Northars. However recent intelligence reports gleaned by the Magus Council and circulated to the Order and Guardian Sects suggests that Lilar Herself has visited the Temple. Even ignoring the pomp and ceremony that must have surrounded such a visit, it is curious as to why the Goddess of Vengence would wish to see the landing point of her Divine Uncle. Anvar sources and certains texts found in the Vorn City libary indicate that it may have been to awaken the Venai Ravna buried underneath Islara. But Venai Ravna are known to look favourably upon Anvar, and indeed the Northars. This may not bode well for the Magus Council.</div>
