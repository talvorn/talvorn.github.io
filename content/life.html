<br>
<font face="times new roman">The Life Sect, the breed of Magic first
devised by the Elves, focuses upon the control of living things, be it
animal or plant life, and contains many summoning spells as well
as the ability to accelerate plant growth and alter their own body in a
number of different forms. It is quite powerful; the ability to disable
your opponent due the grass underfoot wrapping itself around him is not
one to be underestimated.<br>
<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Life Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Wrath of the Immortal</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster is empowered with
incredible strength, speed, agility, and resistance. The effect of this
spell is simple; it gives Super-Elder strength. When this spell is used
on someone, they become the strongest of warriors, despite any prior
ineptitudes.</i><br></li><li> <b>Force of Nature</b><br>
<i>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a blindingly
bright orb of emerald green light. Bouncing off of any surface, this
orb absorbs any and all life that it touches; growing larger with each
acquisition of life force. Anything touched by this spell is killed
instantly.</i></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>

<br>
Originally developed by the Elves of Lathrandar forest, Life Magic has
since spread; becoming quite popular with Rangers and Druidic cultures
and tribes. The effects of Life Magic can be seen almost anywhere, and
this is, indeed, one of it's goals as a sect: To bring green to all of
Tal'Vorn. Most in the Life Sect would love nothing more than to see the
Wastes of Vorn become a Life-nurturing forest or jungle, and the same
for everywhere; even the Isle of the Dead.<br>
<br>
The Symbol of the Life Sect is the Fallen Leaf.<br>
<br>
The Current Lady Life is Alexandra TreeCaller.<br>
