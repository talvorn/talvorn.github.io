When the Beasts were born from the wild inundation of magic that
occurred when Grathis crafted the Mani at the beginning of the Time of
Gods, some were also born with the gift of magic in their veins. These
Beasts became the Shaman of the Packs and the magic that they cast
became known as Pack Magic. It draws upon the Beasts roots in nature,
with their link to the wild animals of Tal'Vorn and the innate
strengths that such creatures have.<br>
<br>
With the most powerful of Pack Magics, the Shaman can call up herds of
wild creatures to aid the Beast tribe in their war against the
Elves and Lar'K'Leth, against the usurper humanity. Yet it can
also turn a weakling into a ferocious warrior by unlocking the animal
within, the raging inferno of sheer ferocity that pounds within the
breast of every Beast, the endless font of jealousy and envy against the
other Races.<br>
<br>
Pack Magic is not, obviously enough, represented on the Magus Council 
and indeed the Council refuses to admit that the Magic even exists. 
This is a typical attitude from the human rulers as they have no desire 
to admit that any kind of magic might be beyond them..
