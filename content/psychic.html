<br>
<font face="times new roman">Though it is difficult to become a Psychic
Magic User, once you have learnt this incredibly powerful magic, you
would become nigh unstoppable. You would be able to alter your
reality, lift things with your mind, change how people perceive you,
alter how their very senses receive information. Put simply, Psychic
Sect utilizes the Power of the Mind.<br>
</font><blockquote><font face="times new roman"><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Psychic Magic is a
method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's
own Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are
too powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote><ul><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Telekinesis Totallus Absolutus</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster exerts his strength of will over everything in the general vicinity.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Time Walking</b><br>
<i>Calling on the ultimate form of manipulation of the Theory of
Interspatial-Time Dynamics, the caster is able to step through time and
space as easily as if it were but air. [This is not a Forbidden Spell
usable by PCs]</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><font face="times new roman"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>

<br>
Yet the Psychic Sect is not one for major demonstrations of power,
preferring to keep themselves hidden away from the prying eyes of the
Order. Their relations with the other Sects is strained at best,
especially with the Research and Order Sects, the former desiring the
knowledge privy to those able to utilise Psychic Magic and the latter
worried about the implications to security that Psychic Magic implies.
However there are several occasions upon which the unique talents of
the Psychic Sect have been called upon by the Order, generally in the
interrogation of prisoners who have had their memories either wiped or
are suffering from some deep rooted trauma or amnesia. In this same
vein, some Psychic Casters work closely with the Healer Sect in
determining the extent of mental damage on a patient.<br>
<br>
Psykers are generally either Human or Ether Walkers, Humanity showing
an interesting ability with the Magic of the mind that would not,
perhaps, be expected in such a Race.<br>
<br>
The symbol used by the Psychic Sect is the Lidless Eye, a mark that
shows that the power of the Sect allows them to see all.<br>

<br>
It is difficult to know the current Lord Psychic, for once their powers
have increased enough for them to traverse time, they will
occasionally change time periods when they have grown tired of their
natural time-line. Thus, it is considered 'ordinary' to have a Lord
Psychic grace Magus Council Meetings when they haven't even been born
yet. The most notable Lord Psychics to work in this time period of
Tal'Vorn is Alexandre ThoughtBreaker, and Christoph MindStealer.
However, the last one seen operating in the stead of the Lord Psychic
of this era was Alexandre.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1"><font face="times new roman"><b><i><font size="4">The Theory of Interspatial-Time Dynamics</font></i></b><br>
<br>
Though strictly speaking one of the younger Sects, time means nothing
to a Psychic Mage, for when skilled enough they can step backwards and
forwards through the very barriers of reality itself because of the
Theory of Interspatial-Time Dynamics. This states that at one point in
time all things were in the same place and so all time must have been
in the same place and as all time was in one place, that one place
could have been anywhere and thus all time can be accessed from
anywhere. Whether or not the Theory is true is irrelevant as Psychic
Casters can alter reality. Thus they only have to <b>believe</b> it is true for it <b>be</b> true.<br>

<b>General Allies</b>: <i>Universe, Guardian</i><br>

<b>General Hostilities</b>: <i>Research, Order</i><br>
<b>Main Goals of the Psychic Sect</b>:</font><blockquote><font face="times new roman"><b>-</b> Increase it's Power Base<br>
<b>-</b> Increase it's knowledge<br>

<b>-</b> Protect said knowledge from intruders or outsiders</font></blockquote><br>
