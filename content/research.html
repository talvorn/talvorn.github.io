<br>
<font face="times new roman">The magic of the Research Sect is,
quite simply, the magic of science. Spells that disrupt another caster,
open, fix, mend, or destroy mechanical machinations are easily within
the range of the Research Sect. It is also within the Research Sects
power to alter, manipulate, create, or destroy magnetism of any kind.<br>
</font><blockquote><font face="times new roman"><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Research Magic is a method
for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own
Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too
powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to weild.</font></blockquote><ul><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Unlimited Power</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster creates what is almost
akin to a Mani fuel source: Mani itself powers a machine, and due to
the nature of mani, the machine gains almost infinite power while this
spell endures. Casting this spell while inside of a Mecha, like a PTAU
for instance, would grant the wielder incredible power.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Force of Research</b><br>

<i>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster utilizes the Surrounding
Mani to create thousands of tiny Nanites which group together, and
proceed to destroy any living tissue in the general vacinity of it's
casting.</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><font face="times new roman"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Research Sect, though it holds a seat upon the Magus Council, is
perhaps the weakest of all the Sects. Though no Sect can afford to
alienate the techno-mages of the Research Sect, most of the Sects still
do not hold them in a high opinion, and perhaps for good reason. In
combat the spells of the Research Sect are defensive rather then
offensive, focusing upon the preservation of the Caster whilst he either
escapes or whilst any companions prepare more aggressive spells. At
first glance such a focus upon the defence rather then the attack would
not be attractive enough for the Research Sect to maintain even what
limited numbers it does command.<br>
<br>
However the Research Sect does more then just fight. They are the
masters of all kinds of bizarre technologies and magical devices,
utilising their skills as engineers as well as Casters. Of course this
has led to some more . . . interesting . . . results including
rampaging mutant chairs, biting swords, screaming pens and other such
incidents. And, naturally, a potentially fatal explosion is always
around the corner when you are working in any Research Sect lab.<br>
<br>
Due to the secretive nature of the Psychic sect, a slight enmity has
grown between them and the Research Sect, who's goal is to collect
knowledge.<br>

<br>
The Symbol of the Research Sect is an Open Book.<br>
<br>
The Current Lord Research is Derek Deirdre Deftspark, The Mastermind of
Mischievous Machinations, Eccentric Executor of Egregious Excogitations
and Roy of Research.<br>
