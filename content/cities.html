<b><font color="#bc9d5e">CRIMLIS</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

It is a well known fact that each Angel city is a pinnacle of the 

breed it represents. Either for culture, economic prowess, military 

power or judicial splendour, each one is the height of it’s breeds’ 

achievement.<Br>
<Br>
Crimlis is no different, it’s inhabitants, isolated to the point of 

exile, have practically formed a breed of their own. They are the 

fallen, Crimlis their home. Those sent to the isle of Ilattaerar are 

the scourge of the Angel race. Criminals, idlers and dreamers all they 

are looked down upon as those who wish to destroy the Angel hierarchy 

(occasionally with an element of truth).<Br>
<Br>
The city itself is not as foreboding as the name would imply. At a 

glance, it would appear as a human city (it’s inhabitants forced to 

walk and carry their partially stripped wings in shame) with only a 

huge poor district. Void of wealth and kept under Angel jurisdiction 

only by a single Black wing outpost, Crimlis is a collection of slums, 

drinking houses and all other manner of vice frowned upon by 

traditional Angel belief. It is a sprawling mass of housing, at it’s 

core rising up to a great height of ramshackle building-on-building 

constructions. (Silent Nomad)
<br><font size="1">[ <a href="#top">Back to top</a></font> ]<br><br>


<center><A name="dar"></A>
<b><font color="#bc9d5e">DAR</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

The last human city, Dar was purposefully settled on the other side of 

the (relatively) thin sea barrier known as the Fang Gulf. This stretch 

of shallow water originally connected Ilattaerar to the Great 

Continent, the cause of it’s current state is unknown. The waters are 

so shallow that Jagged rocks protrude in clusters, permeating the 

surface with thousands of islands. This phenomenon makes the isle 

itself almost unreachable by sea, only the most experienced of 

fishermen venturing out to take advantage of the huge fish stocks in 

the Gulf shelters. This barrier, combined with an almost unique 

one-way jump gate in Dar’s core, render both city and Island an 

effective prison.<br>
<br>
This title is most suiting as Dar’s inhabitants are comprised of the 

roughest, most violent undesirables of the Human race. Criminals, 

Heretics and brave former politicians inhabit this place, in short, 

all those who defy the rule of the Magus.<br>
<br>
As for the city itself, Dar bears much in common with it’s Angel 

sister Crimlis, a similarity that has led to an indescribable sense of 

companionship between the two races in this isolate environment. It is 

ironic that such cruel punishment is capable of breaking down the 

barrier of mistrust between races. On some rare occasion, the 

accomplishment of trust between races has been known to develop into 

the condition known commonly as “love.” However, such instances are 

undocumented by the Angels and all half-breeds are burnt as a matter 

of racial honour by the Black Wing. Though it should be noted that 

this opinion is not shared by humans as a whole, and barely shared by 

the Magus who have long since ceased caring for the welfare and 

condition of Dar and those inside her.<br>
<br>
Dar has no walls as such, it is a sprawling mass of housing, 

uncontrolled by the design of the Magus. It’s suburbs (if you can call 

them that) stretch for mile upon mile from the city core, some awaking 

at the earliest of hours to walk to their place of work. As for the 

core, it is notable more for it’s sheer density than it’s height. One 

unaccustomed to it’s passageways would either be lost for long enough 

to be mugged and left for dead, or spend days attempting to leave.

<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

A city built within a mountain, a perfection of crafted stone and 

metal, not a single splinter of wood within it’s walls. A city of 

towering pillars and twinkling lights within a forever half-gloom, yet 

also of sparkling magnificence of gold plated walls telling thousands 

of years of history. Immense forges churn out armour and weapons of 

the finest quality in the world and in the centre of the mountain, 

surrounded by immense doors, traps and soldiers, stands the pride of 

the Dwarf Race, the First Jump Gate. Through this goes a constant flow 

of Dwarves and machines, to mine the great moon, Dragon’s Eye, for 

it’s never ending supply of iron. (Absolution)

<b><font color="#bc9d5e">EHOVIA</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>
The home of the White Winged angels, the Fourth Angel City of Ehovia, 

is about as different from Faber as Elis is from Regalis. Because it 

is a city of labourers, everything in the city is designed with 

function first and form taking a back seat to anything else. The stark 

white marble that comprises the city is seamless just like the other 

cities, but it is designed only to provide a shelter for the 

white-winged labourers as they return from their daily toiling. It is 

the smallest city, only because it does not have to be great. On most 

days, the residential portion of the city is almost completely empty, 

every inhabitant off tending their land, flocks, and other duties. 

(Angel)

<center><A name="elis"></A>
<b><font color="#bc9d5e">ELIS</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

The Fifth and final Angel City is home to the Black Winged warrior 

angels. It is also the second of two entrances into the chain of 

cities, the first being located at Regalis. Ebony marble covers 

everything in the illusion of perpetual shadow, but though the marble 

is seamless, sharp angles are the dominant features of buildings. Like 

the Fourth City, form takes a back seat to function, but not to such a 

degree. Warriors do not need the lavish comforts of Regalis or Faber, 

so they are not given comforts.<br>
<br>
In the center of the black city lies the College of War, the foremost 

training grounds for the Black Angels, and one of the greatest 

military academies on the face of the planet. Yet even though it is 

one of the best, only Angels are allowed to train there. As such, only 

fellow angels know the methods and secrets that are passed from 

commanders to students. Many believe this to be wrong, that all races 

should be able to train at the best college of war. The Angels, 

however, do not feel the same. And since they completely control who 

is able to come into the cities, nobody has been able to lead a 

successful rebellion to change their minds. (Angel)

<b><font color="#bc9d5e">FABER</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>
After proceeding through the first city's awe-inspiring majesty, it 

would be nigh impossible to believe that anything could be more 

beautiful than Regalis. But, alas, nothing is impossible for those who 

were created as a race of perfection, and the Sky blue city of Faber 

is their shining triumph. it is a city of flawless perfection crafted 

by the hands of the Blue winged artisans. Yet unlike Regalis or Zatay, 

not a single living plant can be found anywhere on the city's cold 

marble surfaces. Every surface is covered with the most intricate 

carving, the most detailed inscriptions, so flawless that one would 

believe that they were not crafted by hands, but simply grew naturally 

into the marble.<Br>
<br>
Yet this flawless perfection is not appreciated by all races, the 

elves foremost believing it to be a heresy against their Lady Vriclar 

Herself to be so devoid of life. It is in this flawless perfection that 

the blue-winged angels produce their crafts of granite, jade, bone, 

ivory, ebony, obsidian, ruby, emerald, diamonds, sapphire, gold, 

silver, platinum and a thousand other metals and materials for the 

nobility of Tal'Vorn. (Angel)

<center><A name="grath"></A>
<b><font color="#bc9d5e">GRATH</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

Men became aware of their power to alter reality when they managed to 

transform the basic metals and forged the first alloy. Maybe this is 

why Grath is a metal city: a praise to human powers, a monument to 

progress.<br>
<br>
Facing the magical island, and close to the shore, Grath seems like a 

defiance to magic. A marvellous show of human ability, able to rival 

magic with the sole ability of intelligence.<br>
<br>
Shining in brass, iron and steel, buildings are designed to defy 

nature and take advantage of its benefits. Genius of craft, the 

inhabitants of Grath city managed to raise a city of self preserving 

standards. Not a ray of sun to be wasted, not a gust of wind to flow 

away freely, not a drop of water passing without generating.<br>
<br>
The city is practically devoted to transformation and their habitants 

are ever working, busy as bees and countless, like ants. In Grath, 

machines do not free men. People multiply around them and take care of 

them just as worshippers of a metal god.<br>
<br>
All the buildings are related to each other in search for efficiency. 

And if someone watches the city from the air, will see something very 

similar to clockwork. Fumes and vapours come out of millions of 

turrets, like incense to praise industrial life. So even the sky is 

created by their work, as the city is covered in a thick grey fog, and 

air is full of bitter odours.<br>
<br>
Amazing, though, is the no-man’s land that surrounds Grath. Outside 

those luxuriant metal walls but still under the heavy fog that not 

even the blessed winds of the sea carry away, there is a colony of 

destitute. Men that have no use for the unstoppable industry and 

managed to get away from the law that considers all expendable life as 

fertilizer. They roam among the detritus of the city, trying to 

survive among waste. Still even they have a use for the city, as an 

example against indolence. (AliDheren)

<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

Crafted from stone and jungle wood, the city of Karamaterra to the south is

a baking hot realm of towering pyramids and long, low housing. This seeming

contrast is due to the presence of the Earth Sect Headquarters within the

city, the Earth Magic Casters making even complex building work both fast

and simple. Well supplied from the richness of the jungle all around, 

Karamaterra is actually one of the few cities that does not rely upon regular

shipments of grain from the Vorn Plains.(Absolution)

<center><A name="lara"></A>
<b><font color="#bc9d5e">LARA</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

Very little is known of Lara, last stronghold of the Lar'K'Leth. It’s 

location is a very hazy matter, suffice to say it lies relatively 

close to the north-western border of Lathrandar. Relatively, meaning 

the last recorded journey to the edge of the city took eight 

months.<br>
<br>
Several attempts to find the city by easier means have gone by without 

success. It has become known just how intertwined it’s buildings are 

with the forest. It’s greatest skyscrapers are simply the tallest 

trees, flying overhead all that is visible is the canopy, similar to 

the thousands of square miles elsewhere in the forest.<br>
<br>
The Lar'K'Leth reside here as a matter of safety, their numbers 

slowly, slowly dwindling away. Due to this status as a dying race 

their treatment of aliens is surpassed in brutality only by the 

Pravaii. The Lar'K'Leth have no use for torture, if you draw near 

their home, you are certain to receive an arrow to the eye without 

ever catching scent, let alone sight of the most alluring race on 

Tal’Vorn. (Silent Nomad)

Lathra is a place of great beauty and pure simplicity. Everything in the

naturally stripped bark. The city is also home to the Elven Queen, and

<center><A name="maguscouncil"></A>
<b><font color="#bc9d5e">MAGUS COUNCIL</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

On the bay-mouth facing arc of the Dragon Isle, the coast is barren. 

Being the only part of the isle exposed to winter storms blowing in 

through the bay, the cliffs are steep and jagged, little grows 

here.<br>
<br>
It could be considered ironic then, that this uninhabitable 

environment harbours the last Stronghold of the Human race. The Magus 

Council was constructed by those who knew what many still deny. Sooner 

or later, the human race will come under threat of extinction. With 

this in mind, the Magus Council is the most fortified point of human 

habitation on Tal’Vorn.<br>
<br>
From overhead very little of the fortress itself is visible. What is 

visible makes for a daunting site to any visitor. Two towers, carved 

out of the cliff face in polished, black rock rise up to over two 

hundred feet. These towers, though usually more or less empty, 

darkness peers out of window slits at intervals up the base, 

culminating in a fully roofed bunker. Heavily armoured by rock, these 

rooms, in times of need, are filled with all manner of devices, from 

boiling oil to the most powerful ballista and of course, members of 

the most powerful of the Magus bolstering defences. But for now, these 

rooms remain silent, slowly gathering dust until the time comes when 

they will be needed.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the fortress, a large part is dedicated to the 

necessities to take a mass influx of mankind’s’ populous into the 

fortress. Huge mess halls, reservoirs and dormitories buried deep 

underground. For now, like the two towers, they lie silent, waiting. 

The centrepiece of the entire structure lies buried nearly a mile 

underground. A great amphitheatre, housing thousands of spectators 

(most notably the twelve Lords/Ladies of the Magus Council and the 

Lord Fighter in raised seats). It is here that annually the Magus 

Council come together to decide the Lord Magus of the coming year, by 

a great duel known as the Trials of Power.

<center><A name="primus"></A>
<b><font color="#bc9d5e">PRIMUS</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

When the Rain of Fire first impacted the lush meadows of Ilars, the 

southern most point of land on Tal'Vorn, the few million strong humans 

were largely ignored by the native races.
<br><br>
This, self-imposed ignorance would prove their undoing. On this 

southern tip the humans made their home, a city which, through their 

own ignorance was named, “Primus.” (First)<br>
<br>
To understand the terrible fate of Primus it must be understood how 

the humans came to Tal Vorn. The human colonization was intentional, 

it’s original purpose however is unknown. The “Rain of Fire,” refers 

to the disastrous result of a minute miscalculation in landing 

trajectory. In short, the vast majority of the human fleet deflected 

of the upper atmosphere of the planet, their ships damaged beyond 

repair, and drifted into space, lost forever. Those that survived 

entry, most crashed in to the surrounding ocean. In short, from the 

rough billion intended to colonise the planet, less then a million 

survived landing.<br>
<br>
Those that did wasted little time in mourning, with the hope of a new 

and fruitful life firmly embedded in their hearts they set about 

constructing Primus. The city was built using technology unfathomable 

by the native races to this day, commonly known as “High Technology.” 

The humans, aware of the native wildlife, encircled their new home in 

formidable defences. Great walls linked to Energy shield generators, 

Ion cannon emplacements and numerous innovative defences satiated 

their thirst for total security.<br>
<br>
However the Humans remained ignorant of the presence of native 

intelligent life. A scout party, sent to search out a site for a 

second city, stumbled across a group of Dragon Lords mid-celebration. 

The sight of the drunken, copulating, feasting creatures struck new 

fear in the Humans, the fear of an intellect, a force, greater then 

their own. The Human soul, plagued by many demons, at a time of great 

need reverts to one master, instinct. This simple collection of 

responses and reactions, as old as the race itself, is the last refuge 

of the Human soul. Instinct has simple facets, all keyed for nothing 

greater then self-preservation, fear being the greatest of all.<br>
<br>
It was to here that the Human souls retreated, in their fear they 

performed the one, doom-ridden act keyed to keep them alive, a sad 

irony. They opened fire. All but one of the Dragon Lords were slain 

and the scouts, terrified as much by their own actions as anything 

else retreated with all haste.<br>
<br>
The resulting war, in which the DragonLords called all native races to 

them as allies, left Primus destroyed but at a terrible cost. All 

trace of High Technology was buried or obliterated and immense loss of life 

on both sides left the city a soaking mess of rubble and 

blood-drenched mud. Nothing resides there now. The humans, those few 

granted mercy by the Elder Races, were scattered to three harsh 

climates where they settled, stripped of their technology. As for the 

DragonLords, this conflict spelt the beginning of the end for their 

race, their numbers slowly dwindling ever since. They are nearing the 

genetic point of no return as the years pass. The Merman, Anvar and 

Dwarves especially suffered and have since ceased to be the dominating 

powers they once were.<br>
<br>
As for Primus, Ilars became known as “The Isle of the Dead.” The truly 

vast traffic of souls leaving the area attracted some of the greatest 

Demons inhabiting the planet. The city, what’s left of it, drenched in 

the blood of the fallen, still harbours High Technology left behind, 

for all those fool enough to seek it. (Silent Nomad)

Regalis, the first Angel City, is one of two gateways into the cities. 

Its royal violet marble is flawless in perfection and surpassed in 

beauty only by the sky blue marble of Faber. It is in this city that 

the first breed of Angels, the gold-winged princes, make their home. 

It sets the standard of what to expect when you travel to the rest of 

the cities, and what a high standard is set. The marble is joined 

seamlessly throughout the city, each building flowing into the next 

like the city was moulded and not carved. An abundance of plants and 

vines grow all across the smooth marble, but their presence only 

serves to lower the self-image of any traveller who wishes to proceed 

through to the next cities. It is truly a city made to impress, and it

Set in the centre of Vorn City, Tal Hill is a stark contrast to it’s 

filth ridden cousin. Home to the nobility, it is surrounded by high 

walls and gates of iron, defended by Guardians and Warriors at all 

times to prevent unauthorized entry. Tal Hill itself is several miles 

high, a plinth of stone in the barren glass sea that now surrounds 

Vorn City. The top is flat as a coin, a beautiful paradise of trees 

and white stone buildings, where the birds sing and there are no cries 

of death and violence. Dominating it all is the Mayor of Vorn City’s 

home, a sprawling mansion, half as tall again as any other individual 

building on Tal’Vorn’s face. Most of the Sect Lord's maintain a home 

here, even if they do not use it, seeing it as a sort of prestige 

symbol to have a house in the largest and most expensive city on 

Tal'Vorn. Hawkers and salesmen are not permitted to enter the City, 

instead all the food is brought in and shipped directly to the houses 

by the servants, their masters dining on the finest of foods whilst 

the slum dwellers of Vorn City have to subsidise on the paltry fare 

that the Magus Council give out each day. (Absolution)

<b><font color="#bc9d5e">TRATH</font></b><br>
<img src="/images/bar.gif"><br></center>

The seas that stretch between the Great Continent and the Eastern 

Lands are largely uncharted. Travel between the two landmasses by sea 

is difficult at best, taking months under a favourable wind to make 

one crossing. Winter storms render such a huge mass of water a 

churning swell that has been known to swallow small Islands in one 

season. Due to this, the limited charts of the ocean are near useless 

for true navigation as the small land masses they denote may well not 

exist.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the weather systems that create the storms are largely 

created between the two land masses, to their south and almost equal 

distance between the two, lie the semi-isolate Arrow-head Isles. A 

collection of small tropical islands surrounded by shallow reefs and 

little deep water give the Isles two great attractions. The fish and 

the view.<br>
<br>
Consequently, the largest Island harbours the unusual city of Trath. 

Unusual as it’s populace are comprised almost exclusively of two 

sorts, Nobles and Fishermen. What is most incredible is the apparent 

lack of mistrust between the two, apparently the taste of paradise in 

a harsh world softens the soul. There is no dividing wall between the 

mansions of the rich and the humble houses of the poor, they co-exist 

with a degree of companionship. The rich provide the funds needed to 

trade with the outside world and in return the fishermen provide an 

almost unlimited source of food (and exotic food at that).<br>
<br>
Trath is a pinnacle of co-existence between traditionally separate 

classes, it is isolated from the majority of Tal Vorn, accessible only 

by Jump Gate. Though under rule by the Magus as all the human cities 

are, the richest of the inhabitants are careful to keep the city’s 

freedom protected and so no armed guard or Magus presence keeps too 

close an eye on Trath, much to the content of her citizens. (Silent

A sprawling metropolis of a billion people, Vorn City is slums for 

miles in every direction, stretching from horizon to horizon. Here 

people eke out their pathetic lives for the money to eat well for a 

few days, to live off of something other then the bread, water and 

bean curd provided by the Magus Council. Below the city is a sprawling 

mass of tunnels where crime is disorganised but rife. There are few 

Order patrols here in this dark under-city and the subterranean realms 

inhabitants pray upon each other to survive, stealing and killing for 

money and food. And far below it is a whisper of the impossible, of a 

realm controlled by the thieves, where no Order walk, where rough 

sorcerers hatch their plots and where the Crime Lords rule with an 

iron fist. Surrounding Vorn City is a high wall of stone, heavily 

enchanted, that protects the slum dwellers from the death realised 

that is the Glass Wastes that surround the city. Arranged within the 

city are four Jump Gates, their energies almost constantly sparking 

with a steady flow of traffic in and out of Vorn City, wagons carrying 

food or weapons, people coming in to sell goods, Warriors or Mages 

moving from city to city through the gates. Vorn City is by far the 

largest of the Tal'Vorn Cities and it is somewhat fitting that it 

should belong to the most numerically superior race, the humans.

greys are the diplomats and traders among the Angels, and as such, 

their city receives the largest number of visitors. Zatay, like all of 

the other Angel Cities, is built from a what appears to be a single

is meant to impress royalty and Faber is designed to perfection, Zatay 

was designed with the comfort of every race in mind.<br>

Every doorway save those of residences is sized large enough for the 

mighty Anvar to easily pass through, and surrounding the centre of the 

city is a large shrine to each of the gods. Each temple is quite 

lavish, no expense spared in creating an environment that is soothing 

to every race and religion that visits. But even more than that fact 

is the incredible variety of foods available for purchase. Each race 

is accommodated with great amounts of anything they wish from fruit to 

meat to produce and the like. The city's appearance is also welcoming, 

a pleasant mix between mechanical precision and natural beauty. It
