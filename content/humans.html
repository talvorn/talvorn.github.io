Humanity came to Tal'Vorn almost one and a half
thousand years ago and in that time their
population has exploded until they are more
populous then the Angels, DragonLords,
Dwarves, Elves, Fae and Mermen put
together. They are resourceful, adaptable,
ruthless, manipulative, deceitful, greedy, vain,
noble, courageous, petty, childish and foolish.
Humanity is the true contradictory race and
indeed it is perhaps because of this that they are
so totally hated by so many of the other Races.

<b>Physical Description:</b> Humans range from five
and a half feet to just over six and a half in height
on average, with males being typically taller and
heavier then females. Their hair colours run the
usual gauntlet of shades from black to red to
blonde, with eyes doing a similar thing with
brown ranging to green and blue. Skin tones for
humans are quite varied, from dark ebony shades
to almost paper white. Humanity is also
apparently able to interbreed with a lot of
Tal'Vorns Elder races, resulting in many humans
having at least a smattering of hybrid blood in
them, typically Elven, Soulless or Mermish.
DragonLord/Human Hybrids have been known,
but typically have a very low life expectancy due
to the violence of DragonLord reactions to such
creatures. Something that does mark Humans out
from most of the other Races, but isn't immediately apparent, is their talent for Psychic
Magic. Originally created and designed by the
mysterious Ether Walkers, a species of Elder
Race created by the God of Fate. Timus. No other
Race, other then the Ether Walkers, was capable
of casting even a simple Psychic cantrip, until
Humanity arrived. They mastered the Magic like
every other, and have show worrying skill in it,
exceeding many of the best Psykers amongst the
Ether Walkers.

<b>Personality:</b> Humans are without doubt the most
morally flexible of the Races. Whilst some are
braver and more noble and some sink to lower
depths of depravity and cruelty, few manage to do
so within the same species. Adaptable and
resourceful, Humans learn quickly, picking up
basic concepts very easily allowing them to
capitalise on any possible opportunities. Whilst
they may lack the sheer courage of DragonLords,
the stubbornness of the Dwarves or the sheer joy
at life of the Mermen, they still enjoy the broadest
range of emotional responses of any Race, bar
Soulless and Fae. Indeed sometimes the
apparently extreme emotional reactions of
Humans can confuse and irritate the other Races.
<Br>
<Br>
<Br>
<b>Religion:</b> Humans have no singular driving
religion. Like all of the other Races, they know
the Gods exist, but have no idea which God, if
any, created them so long ago. As such, Each Sect
has a favoured God, and Sect Members typically
worship this God over others. They pray to other
Gods as the circumstances dictate: Shaltar the
AllFather receives battle-prayers, Javersith pleas
for mercy or succour from sickness, Zarner, God
of the Dead hears those who wish their loved
ones to rest in peace and so on, each God being
worshipped in turn.
<Br>
<Br>
<Br>
<b>Relations:</b> Humanity does its best to get by
without causing too much trouble. Though they
outnumber the other Races, they are also well
aware of their position outside the natural order
of Tal'Vorn. They are well aware of their
relatively frail physical capabilities when placed
beside such creatures as Anvar, DragonLords or
even Soulless and as such try to keep their heads
down and mouths relatively shut as a species.
<Br>
<Br>
<Br>
<b>Territory:</b> Humans control by far the largest
amount of territory of any other Race on Tal'Vorn.
They have multiple cities on multiple continents
in multiple hemispheres, all of them teeming with
human life. From the steely orb of Vorn City to
the port town of Grath to the towering pyramid city Karamaterra in the jungles of the Great
Continent, the humans have the edge in raw
population. Not only that but they control the
majority of the Jump Gate Communities as well,
giving them unprecedented swift travel. In fact
the Magus Council, the ruling body of Humanity,
has been in place so long and has so much power
that it is actually the primary controlling
government of the entire planet, with many
representatives of the other Races being members
of the Councils Sects.
<Br>
<Br>
<Br>
<b>Language:</b> Humans speak Common, though they
are quite capable of learning most of the other
languages on Tal'Vorn.
<Br>
<Br>
<Br>
<b>Names:</b> Humans are as flexible in their names as
everything else they do, typically using names
that the parent simply finds interesting or
amusing at the time. As such, Humanity uses any
and all of the naming conventions of the other
Races.
