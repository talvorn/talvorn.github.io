Of all the sects the DarkSiders are the most feared and the least
known. They may be the smallest of all the Sects but they make up for
this through sheer raw power. A sub-Sect of the Order, they are tasked
with the most difficult of missions and with their ability to use any
spells they desire, they rarely if ever fail in what they do. <br>
<br>
Very little is known about the DarkSiders and those who make up their
ranks since most that encounter the DarkSiders don.t live to tell the
tale. No one aside the members of this Sect even know the exact
location of their Headquarters, however rumours suggest that its
somewhere in the south-west lower levels of Vorn City, due to multiple
unexplained disappearances of would be thieves and muggers. The
Headquarters itself is protected by powerful charms of concealment and
can only be accessed via teleportation into the main entrance hallway,
something which would be suicidal for any would be intruder.<br>
<br>
A DarkSiders can only be told apart from a Dark Caster by the small
amount of gold trim to their robes, the higher up members often also
have golden designs on the shoulders and backs of their robes to
display their status. DarkSiders often work under cover within groups
of Dark Casters for purposes of intelligence gathering: the reason behind
their robe designs.
