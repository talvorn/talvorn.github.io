<br>
<font face="times new roman">Order magic is specifically targeted for
the controlling of crowds, as well as individuals. It is perfectly able
to do such things as create shields, cause paralysis, as well as
cause pain, although the last not as efficiently as Dark Magic can.
Order Magic was creating for 'crowd control', and as such, is
exceedingly apt at it.<br>
</font><blockquote><font face="times new roman"><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Order Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote><ul><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Flay</b><br>

<i>Utilizing the heaviest form of Order Magic, the caster tears the
flesh, and muscle from his enemies' bones, all the while keeping them
alive during the process. Immense pain is felt during this time, as the
nerves and brain are the last things to be destroyed. The end effect is
quite lethal; death by either exsanguination, or the utter ruin of all
bodily functions and systems.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Death</b><br>

<i>Instantly stops all bodily functions in one target. Heartbeat,
breathing, brain activity, even the circulatory system, given that the
subject of the spell has one.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Destruction</b><br>
<i>Instantly destroys any target item bearing an enchantment or scripture rune.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Eternal Torment</b><br>
<i>Grants the afflicted immortality, but also puts them in horrendous
pain for the rest of time. Used most commonly in the Torment Engines
that the Order use to hold certain criminals.</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><font face="times new roman"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>

The Order are a group of Magic Users who work under the control of the
Magus Council, that group of shadowy spell casters that controls all
the human comings and goings on Tal'Vorn. The Order themselves answer
only to the Lord Magus, at the moment one Robert LightBringer, Guardian
Lord, and to their own Sect Lady, Lisha SilverSword. This gives them an
unprecedented level of freedom and an ability to act mostly as they
please so long as they do not anger the Lord Magus, one of his allies
or the Lady Order.<br>
<br>
Generally Order members are known as policemen and protectors, those
who preserve the peace and maintain the status quo. Of course as with
any great organization, absolute power corrupts absolutely and there
are many rumoured reports of Order members attacking members of the
public unprovoked, the most loudly voiced complaints coming from the
Lord Magus himself. Though Lisha SilverSword says that they investigate
the truth of the matter, it is doubtful if the actual facts will ever
really come to light or if it will simply be covered up by some corrupt
Order Sorcerer.<br>

<br>
The Order has the origins in the turmoil following the Great War. When
the humans began to settle the city of Vorn, crime was rife as the
limited food supplies were stretched to breaking point. To prevent
absolute anarchy, the first Order Lord was created and was given the
power of judge, jury and executioner to prevent further drains
upon the newly formed Magus Council's already stretched resources.
For a while the Order Lord, who's name was struck from the records as a
matter of general internal security for the Order, actually trained his
students himself, until there where enough to police Vorn City, some
three thousand Order Wizards, a thousand Order Mages, five hundred
Sorcerers, twelve Masters and himself. Of course over time the numbers
of Mages and Wizards have swollen until not even the current Lady Order
is entirely certain how many Order members there actually are.<br>
<br>
The Current Lady Order is Lisha SilverSword.<br>
<br>
For many years now, ever since symbols first came into the heraldry of
the Magus Council, the Order has been represented by the arrow, the
single direction it provides representing the Order ideal.</font>
