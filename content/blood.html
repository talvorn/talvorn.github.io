Blood Magic is a creation of the foul Pravaii, the Stricken Elves,
birthed from their overwhelming desire to reclaim their immortality and
is also used by the Demons as a way of showing their loyalty to their
God, Killar the Bloody Handed. It is a brutal magic, that has no need
for the Mani that the other Magics use to fuel their spells. Instead it
uses the pure blood of the caster, or a recent sacrifice, to cause
the desired effect, be it a weapon formed of blood, some sort of
magical projectile, defensive barriers or even, with stronger Casters,
summoning the very dead themselves from the grave.<br>
<br>
Of course the most powerful Blood Magic users are the Pravaii
Heirophant, the Domina Curor and the Night Daemons. These few are
capable of calling upon immense power and dealing out terrible damage.
Blood Magic is a slayer of living things, a vampiric magic that will
then use the energy of those just slain against anything still living
that opposes it's wielder. It is not a magic to be underestimated or
ignored simply because it has a limited amount of usage or because only
a few are capable of wielding it with any great skill.<br>


<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Blood Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield. However, only the records of the incantations are kept here, and nothing stops a powerful Pravaii or Demon from unlocking these spells.</blockquote>

<ul><li> <b>Raise Mortalis</b><br>
<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster summons into existence a creature called a Mortalis. Made of grave dirt, bone and blood, whilst in contact with the ground, a Mortalis cannot be killed. It takes its strength from the soil, able to increase its body size or stretch its limbs at will. Though incapable of magic, a Mortalis is a powerful and dangerous Woken Dead.</i><br></li><li> 

<b>Blood Boil</b><br>
<i>Calling on the strongest of their Magics, Blood Casters are able
to literally heat the blood in a victims veins to boiling point. This is, obviously, generally quite painful and rather fatal.</i></li></ul>

<b><i><font size="4">Magic Type Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>

Effectively there is a state of open hostility between the users of
Blood Magic and every other living thing, especially as these living
creatures are mere fuel for the magic in the eyes of the Pravaii and
simple souls for Killar to the Demons. Of course as with any large
group of individuals, all of whom are looking out for number one, there
are always multiple arguments out between those who use Blood Magic and
indeed it is believed that the blood of a Demon is the most useful for
Blood Magic.<br>

<br>
The Symbol of Blood Magic is a drop of blood.<br>
<br>
The most powerful living Blood Magic user is the Pravaii Heirophant.<br>
