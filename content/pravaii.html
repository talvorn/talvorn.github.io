<br><br>

Pravaii revel in pain, torment and power. They lust for nothing less
then the absolute destruction and enslavement of every other living
thing on Tal'Vorn. Vicious and cruel without remorse, yet an individual
Pravaii's life nonetheless revolves around service others, service to
those stronger then they are or with more allies then they have
themselves. To live in the twin cities of the Pravus is to live in a
world filled with false alliances, deceit, lies and betrayal.<br>
<br>
Pravus society is highly structured, with each Pravaii having an exact
place in the social order, ranging from the ruler of the race, the
Hierophant; to the priest class, the Pravaii Curor, the Bloody Handed
Murderers and Priests of Killar, the Lord of Murder; the Veneficus, the
Mages of the Dark Lord; the Nocaii, the Warriors and the Faiitallaii,
the Slaves, the none Pravaii who do everything that the Pravaii wish,
simply to stave off their inevitable sacrifice. A Pravaii's position
within Pravus society relies up on many things, including how well they
serve their superiors and the Pravus race as a whole, how many slaves
they own and can thus sacrifice at the festivals to Killar the Bloody
Handed.<br>
<br>
Within the military the Nocaii are permitted to keep one tenth of
everything they pillage, four tenths going to the commander, two tenths
being 'donated' to the Killar Temples and the remainder belonging to
the Hierophant. In this way is the Pravus society maintained, through
warfare, pillage, murder and destruction. They set out in their great
ships, their Atra Traba, to raid the coasts of the Great Continent and
the Eastern Land. They sail up the mouths of rivers to attack
unsuspecting Jump Gate communities and then escaping again before a
larger force can appear.<br>
<br>
To the Pravaii Curor, their place in Pravus society is fragile, even
more so then any other of the Pravus. Though they are the Priests of
Killar, though they spill blood and offer up hearts in his name, though
they kill and slaughter and drink the blood of the living, still, they
are almost as likely to fall under the knife of sacrifice as any of the
thousands of slaves murdered every day to appease the raging hunger of
the Bloody Handed One. Nearly all female, they are sometimes known as
Killar's Brides, the God of Murder being their life and reason for
being. They drink the blood of the sacrifices as well as bathing in it,
and find themselves rejuvenated by it's power, given eternal beauty and
life by Killar, in place of their creator goddess, Vriclar. This beauty
is ethereal in it's very nature, intoxicating to behold and nigh
irresistible. Indeed many have died willingly just do see a smile upon
the blood red lips of a Curor.<br>
<br>
The Veneficus occupy the highest points of the twin cities, seeking to
separate themselves from the almost constant screams of dying slaves in
the cities below, to seek out the clarity of air that is most suited
for the constructing of spells. It is here that they cast their spells
and expand their power. Moreover, it is they that extend a wreath of
darkness over the Pravus lands, occupying a landmass normally hidden
from view in the north, beyond the Dawn Islands, beyond the known
extent of the Tal'Vorn Seas in the Far Lands.<br>
<br>
Here the Pravus kingdom of ice and stone in the north is protected on
all sides by ragged cliffs, jagged rocks and the wreathing mists and
darkness of the Veneficus. Only the most skilled of the Pravaii
captains can guide their ships through these rocks into the caverns
under the cliffs, into carved tunnels far under the land to the very
bowels of the twin cities. There they land at immense docks, all
wreathed in darkness with just the guttering torchlight to illuminate
their work. There they unload slaves, riches, wood, stone, food and
water, before restocking on soldiers and anything else they require
before sailing out into the seas once more. It takes many months to
make the hazardous journey from the Pravaii lands to the realms of the
other races, one fraught with danger and hardship. Yet they do it
anyway, to claim slaves and wreak terror along the coasts.<br>

<br>
The northern most of the cities, Excuraaii, is the home of the
Hierophant, and is the largest and coldest of the two cities. Here is
where the magic’s of the Veneficus are strongest and here the
boundaries between reality and the Nine Tiers of Hell are rubbed thin.
A sound, like sand on glass, scratches on the nerves all the time. The
Pravaii are born with it, and are unaffected, but it conspires to
steadily drive the weaker minded slaves insane. Not that this in anyway
lessens their value to the experiments of the Veneficus. It is a city
of high spires of stone and metal, of cold air rushing through exposed
streets and terraces, of shuttered windows and doors at night, to ward
away the Demons that flicker in and out of existence during the dark
hours.<br>
<br>
The second city, Formadonaii is where the main temple of Killar is
located and thus has the larger population of Pravaii Corur. This also
means that it has a lower population overall, due to the almost hourly
sacrifices that take place. The streets echo to the laughter of the
Corur and the screams of the slaves as they die. Once a year the city
withstands the madness of the Bloodtime, a single night when the Corur
go out into the streets and slay any they find, spilling their blood in
an orgy of violence, vicious sexual frenzy, murder and rape until the
very streets themselves run red and the spires rain blood to the ground
far below.<br>
<br>
The Pravaii are Elven in their very nature, their faces and bodies
almost identical to their brethren in Lathrandar. Yet it is their minds
and their choices that mark them out as different. The chill north
makes them pale skinned and their Elven heritage makes them dark
haired, yet their lusts, beliefs and desires make them Pravaii,
Stricken, rather then Elven. Millennia ago, the Elven race was divided
into two groups, roughly equal in size, but with incredibly differing
views. The Elven believed that their immortality was gifted to them so
that they could understand the world and nature around them, so that
they could make themselves one with the world that had birthed them,
equal with all living things. On the other hand, the Elves that would
one day become the Pravaii thought that their very existence, their
undying nature, meant that Elves and Elves alone where fit to rule
Tal'Vorn.<br>
<br>
After many decades of arguing, the schism devolved into full-blown
civil war, with Elf slaying Elf for almost a century. Through it all
however, the Elven Queen remained firmly neutral, refusing to choose as
side in the conflict. However eventually she was forced to, after the
Pravaii started killing every living thing and burning down the tree's
just to prove their point, that they where superior to everything. For
this the Elven Queen would not simply watch any longer. She and many of
the Elven Priests begged Vriclar to aid them. The Goddess of Life heard
them and cursed the Pravaii, stripping them of their immortality. From
that day forward, they would age and die like all other living things.<br>
<br>
Confused, terrified and unable to muster the will to fight any longer,
the Pravus took to the seas in great ships and fled to the seas, away
from the vengeful Elven. After many years of wandering without a
homeland, the Pravaii discovered the Grey Lands. After several
unsuccessful attempts at landing, they found the two inlets. Making
their way into the bowels of the earth, they moored at what seemed to
be natural harbours. Making their slow way up in the darkness, they
emerged at the foot of two immense spires of stone, riddled through
with caves, passages and caverns and rooms. It was perfect, a pair of
ready-made fortresses for the Pravaii.<br>
<br>
Moreover, it is there that they have made their abode ever since,
fortifying the spires until it was unassailable. Nevertheless, they
where still dying. Until they where contacted by one of the Old Ones,
one of the Gods. However, this one was not Vriclar. It was Killar, the
Bloody Handed. The God of Murder and Rage saw in the brooding Pravus a
deep seeded hatred against Vriclar and all living things that he could
use for himself.<br>

<br>
Therefore, he offered them immortality again. In exchange for each
sacrifice that they offered up to him, the Pravaii that delivered the
killing blow would be gifted with youth and beauty. They eagerly
accepted, and set out in their great ships to find sacrifices for
Killar. However, the God of Murder was no fool. He knew that once every
Pravaii was immortal again, he would no longer receive the souls of
those they killed in his name. Therefore, he limits their immorality
and beauty. It lasts only a year, before it must be renewed once more.
Moreover, it is this desire to live that drives the Pravaii. And it is
this desire that creates the thousands of alliances and betrayals that
riddle the Pravus society, as each Pravaii seeks out enough allies so
that they are assured enough slaves to sacrifice.<br>
<br>
However, Killar's hunger ever grows, and still does and so the God of
Murder is no longer satisfied with but one sacrifice per year per
Pravaii. Now he demands a hundred deaths in his name for each life he
will grant back as immortality. Thus, the Pravaii have, in recent
years, been driven out into full-blown war with the other Races,
capturing and sacrificing any sentient creatures they could lay their
hands upon. Naturally, this offends the Races and the Humans.
Nevertheless, the Pravaii look so similar to the Elves that the Magus
Council cannot act by the simple presence of the Lady Life, an Elf,
upon their Council. The Elves deny any involvement, but refuse to
explain about their dark brethren.<br>
<br>
Over the years, several Pravaii showed skill with magic that was of a
different caste to the magic’s of Life. Indeed, it was almost totally
opposite, focused instead upon pain and death. Thus, unknown at first,
did the Dark God, the Corrupter, the Despiser, make his presence felt
within Pravus society. Eventually he was revealed, but by this time the
Pravaii where to corrupt, do blinded by years of sacrifice to Killar to
deny the foul God his power over them. And so his Casters took positions
of power, stripping the flesh from the bones of any who opposed them.
Thus was the Shroud crafted, drifting from the towers of the Veneficus
and wreathing all the Grey Lands in a pallor of darkness and confusing
mists.<br>
<br>
The Pravaii fight in a very specific manner, inherent to their basic
mentality and their limitations as a fighting force. Though they can
take to the field of battle in force should they wish to, and once
there they would make a formidable opponent, they prefer to work
through terror and confusion, attacking where the enemy is weakest,
undermining his morale and his support, before dealing the crushing
blow. This is much like how Pravaii politics works, with the
individuals gathering allies and eliminating their weaker opponents to,
in the end, weaken a larger foe.<br>
<br>
Their larger ships, the Atra Traba, sail part way up rivers, until they
are within a few miles of the target. Then the Atra Traba’s unload
multiple smaller craft, each containing troops. The ones containing
foot troops sail up the river, whilst the ones containing cavalry move
immediately to the shore, to allow the horses and the Hastraii to move
up the river under their own power. In this manner, the Atra Traba are
close enough to lend support, but the immense ships do not give the
attack away before it is time. If possible, the Pravaii will also
choose to attack at night, using their superior senses to know when and
where to attack the humans.<br>
<br>
They use troops mounted on horseback to sweep the flanks of a foe,
lashing out with long lances or firing their short-ranged hand
crossbows at point-blank, causing havoc in the lines. Meanwhile the
foot troops armed with vicious halberds, hooked swords, crossbows and
other vicious weaponry, advance into the centre of their lines as
quickly as possible, hitting the enemy before they realise what is
happening. Meanwhile, heavier cavalry, normally mounted upon the
reptilian Hastraii, consisting of the lower nobility armed with long
lances and vicious axes, maces and swords, swing round into the
opponents flanks, their charge nigh irresistible.<br>

<br>
All of their weapons, even their crossbow bolts, are designed to wound
rather then kill. This allows the Pravaii to take a higher proportion
of prisoners then would otherwise be possible. Each prisoner who can
walk is bound together and led behind the Hastraii, forced to run or
fall and be dragged across the ground. Any unable to walk have their
wounds opened up, their ankles and wrists broken to prevent them
crawling away and are left to die. This sort of behaviour is typical of
the Pravaii, destroying what they cannot use and killing what they
cannot capture. Once they reach the boats, the soldiers are loaded on
to them and the prisoners are forced to lead the boats back downstream,
under the watchful eyes of several groups of Hastraii riders. This is a
taster of what is to come for them in their new life as Faiitallaii,
meaning ‘Without Life’. Literally as slaves they can die at any moment,
for any reason and the Pravaii that killed them will not be questioned.<br>
<br>
Once on the boats, this is where at least half of them will die. Their
wounds will not be tended to and thus will fester and putrefy. They are
set to work immediately, forced to either row the immense Atra Traba
through the water, clean the outside of it’s hull, wait upon the
Pravaii, fetch, carry, work as sailors, or be sacrificed upon the
vessels altar. Their life is brutal, harsh, painful and, fortunately
for them, short. Each Atra Traba can spend up to a decade away from
port, normally only coming back to the Grey Lands when they run short
on supplies, too many Pravaii have been injured or killed, or their
compliment of slaves is growing too large. Once in port they will
unload the Hierophants property, half of the surviving slaves, take on
water, troops, food and other supplies before setting sail into the
waters again.<br>
<br>
Pravaii buildings are very different from the ones of the Elven,
focusing upon denying nature rather then accepting it, all hard lines
and sharp edges, cold stone and bitter metal. Immense spires towering
over the land, buildings designed to amplify the screams of the dying,
carvings meant to blind the eye and warp the mind, funnels and grooves
in the ground to channel the blood spilt in the streets, to turn the
stone red and wreath the towers in red mist as the blood falls.<br>
<br>
The arms and armour of the Pravaii focus upon the capture and disabling
of opponents, rather then a swift death. After all, even a crippled
slave is a potential sacrifice. Thus their weapons are barbed to cause
maximum damage and blood loose, hooked and curved to trap limbs and
weapons, and often heavily ornate. This is to show the Pravaii's
position within the Pravus society and his place within the Hierophants
court. Another sign of this is the number of belted weapons a Pravaii
will carry, the most common number amidst the gentry and nobles being
two. A common foot soldier would not carry anything more then a single
simple short bladed knife or sword as well as a long spear. They are
armoured lightly, in mail and half-plate, allowing for more movement
then the full plate worn by human knights. Though this gives less
protection, combined with the unnatural reactions of the Pravaii and
all Elven, it is more important to be mobile then armoured.<br>
<br>
[It is for this reason that many of their forward scouts and raiders
wear no armour at all, using a hand crossbow to cut down their foes
from afar, or the long lance to ride in on horseback, strike at their
opponents and fade away once more before they can be struck. Pravaii
assassins and scouts are the best in the world, able to vanish from
sight at a moments notice. It is said that once a Pravaii assassin has
been commissioned, he will never stop until his target has fallen, be
it by blade, bolt or poison.<br>
<br>
The Hierophant is the ruler of the Pravaii. Immortal and untouchable,
he bathes daily in the blood of a hundred sacrifices, only permitting
the strongest to be slaughtered for his immortality. The Hierophant is,
by his very name, the head of the Pravaii Curor and it is he who leads
the Bloodtime in its madness. When he stalks the streets, all the
Pravaii cower in fear before the coming of their master. It is
whispered that he lived in the time when Elven and the Pravaii actually
where one race, that it was his voice that first gathered followers to
his cause. That it is he and he alone who is responsible for the
dividing of the Elven kind, to fuel his own ambitions.<br>

<br>
However, the Hierophant is also a war leader, and is often away on
campaign, leading his own personal bodyguard in raids and assaults to
claim slaves for himself. Thus the Domina Curor, the Lady Murder, leads
the congregation of murderers. Her name is Era Krasha Lalarllaii,
blessed by Killar and the most beautiful of all the Parvaii. It is even
rumoured that her beauty matches that of the Elven Queen. She is cruel,
cold, heartless and vicious, revelling in the death and sex of the
Bloodtime, living only for the thrill of taking another life. She feels
affection for three things in the entire world. Killar, her bedmate the
Hierophant and her axe, Basiumors, the Kiss of Death, known amidst the
humans as the Betrayers Axe. A weapon of immense power and of cruel
design, it was crafted by the Pravaii soon after their exile. It is of
black metal, it's blade high and razor sharp, barbed and carved to
cause maximum bleeding. But even worse is its grip. Covered in razor
sharp needles, to use the weapon is to spill your own blood in the
process. It is this that gives the Basiumors its power, the power of
wounds that will never close, of blood that will never stop flowing
until the heart stops beating.<br>
<br>
The Pravaii are a cruel race, yet they are a fallen race as well.
Pravus means Stricken and that is what they are. Cast down from what
they once where, they have clawed their way back up again upon the
bodies of those weaker then they. They live only for revenge and for
the chance of immortality like their Elven brethren.<br>
