They call themselves the Children of the Forest.
The Gifted and the Blessed of Lady Vriclar. Yet
the Elves are not all that they may seem and less
then they would wish they are. Talented Warriors
and Casters, they say they fight for the forest, they say that they fight to protect all living things. And yet their Queen knows what they never can. The great Forest of Lathrandar has a voice, a
whispering echo of it's will, and yet it will never
speak to the Elves. The Elves cannot command
the trees or the spirits that dwell in the eaves of
the woods and this makes their self-proclaimed
protection almost pointless.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Physical Description:</b> Elven features are
delicate, cheekbones higher then in humans and
their eyes narrower, but in general are very close
to humanity in appearance. They have eternal
youth though and their skin does not age, leaving
no signs of long life that blemish the flesh and
weaken the body. Their eyes and ears are highly
sensitive and they are amidst the foremost archers
on Tal'Vorn, second only to the Lar'K'Leth
ShadowWalkers. One of the things that marks
them out however is their delicately pointed ears,
similar to those of the Lar'K'Leth. However it is
unknown if Vriclar based her Children upon that
reclusive Race, though several similarities do
point to it. Almost all of them are gifted with exceptional beauty, as befits the children of the Goddess of Life and Beauty, Vriclar. Their looks
has even been known to touch the ferocious
hearts of DragonLords, leading to more then one
Hybrid walking the forest of Lathrandar. More
then just looks, however, being children of the
Vriclar, the Elves have been blessed with one of
Tal'Vorns rarest gifts. That of immortality.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Personality:</b> The Elves have been accused on
more then one occasion of the sin of arrogance. In
some cases, this is completely true. As the Elves
can never die, barring sickness and war, many
believe that this makes them better then the other,
shorter lived Races of Tal'Vorn. Though no Anvar
would ever admit to being the inferior of an Elf,
this doesn't stop some Elves from loudly making
this point. However, the majority are a relatively
benign people, at least in peace. In war however,
one would be a fool to discount their delicate
frame for weakness. Masters of the bow and
consummately skilled in fighting within
woodlands, Elves excel at ambush warfare. They
habitually wear clothing formed of skins or fallen
wood, as these resources are plentiful. Indeed
even the tips of their arrows are typically formed
of flint, rather then metal. In this, as in all things,
the Elves are highly skilled at using the bounty
given to them by the natural world itself.
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Religion:</b> Whilst the Elves revere their Goddess, most of them know that they will not meet her for a long time. As such they often have little interest in obvious displays of faith. A notable exception to this, however, is the One Tree, a truly colossal oak tree in the depths of Lathrandar Forest, which is also the site of the Elves home city, Lathra. The Elves have an undying respect for the One Tree, worshipping it as a representative of Lady Vriclar
upon the world, and as such they refuse to take
any part of it's living wood, building their city
upon the boughs themselves, the tree itself
forming a natural floor of bark and roof of leaves.
The walls were woven from dead wood and fallen
leaves, each leaf of the One Tree being the length
of a man's forearm.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Relations:</b> Elves get on well with many of the
Races, seeing no reason to foster ill will where
there should be little. DragonLords, being
creatures of nature and not given to overt
destruction of the trees, make for surprisingly
close allies. The Dwarves and Humans however,
being creatures of industry, are less then
favoured. The Elves take a dim view of the
cutting down of any tree, especially for
something so pointless as burning or paper.
Lathrandar being so densely wooded, the massive
Anvar find it uncomfortable to navigate and thus
the Elves are mostly spared their pogroms. Fae,
Soulless and Mermen are all welcomed as
interesting and entertaining visitors to the Elven
lands.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Territory:</b> The Elves live, primarily, within the
great Lathrandar Forest, a truly sprawling mass of
woodland and forest that spread for further then
the mind can imagine. Within the depths of the
forest, many of the trees are thousands of years
old, some of them actually managing to reach
more then a thousand meters in height. These
mammoth giants are somewhat rare, however,
with more normal sized trees being the norm
closer to the edges of the Forest. Within the very
core of Lathrandar however, is the largest of the
trees, known as the One Tree. With a base width
of almost a kilometre, the trees branches wave in
the breeze almost five thousand meters above the
surface of the ground.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Language:</b> Elves are, unlike a lot of Races,
completely flippant with their spoken and written
languages, teaching both to anyone who
expresses an interest. They do, however, have
another language which they are less willing to
share. Elven rangers and warriors are taught a
complex form of sign language, enabling them to
communicate silently over short distances.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Names:</b> Elves tend to gather names over their
long years, with lovers and long term friends
giving them nicknames and the Elf him or herself
going by several different names as the whim
occurs to them. For example: Male: Akashi
Futoshi, Haruka, Osami, Taisuke, Takumi, Yuuta
Female: Chihiro, Haruka, Kaori, Saeko, Suzuka ,
Yui
