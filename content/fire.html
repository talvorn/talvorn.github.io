<br>
<font face="times new roman">Focusing on the fiery arts, altering
heat, flames, lava and other heat based phenomena, the Fire Magics are
some of the most outright aggressive, and vary from a well placed
Fireball to an outright Conflagration. This sheer variety of spells
also goes a long way towards explaining the popularity of the Fire Sect.<br>
</font><blockquote><font face="times new roman"><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Fire Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote><ul><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Volcano</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster calls on the Lava and
Fire deep beneath the Earth underfoot, bringing it upward to erupt in a
Volcano directly beneath his enemies' feet. While this may not seem
overly powerful at first thought, it does create a Volcano akin to any
other; the effects of which are deadly, and prolonged.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Force of Fire</b><br>

<i>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a blindingly
bright orb of igneous red flame which consumes all it touches in fire.
Rebounding off everything it touches, anything in the general vicinity
of where a Force of Fire is launched is soon to be a smoking pile of
ash... that is, if even that much is left of it.</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><font face="times new roman"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Fire Sect is the home of some of the most flamboyant Casters alive.
They are also, for some strange reason, amidst the most popular Sects
in the eyes of the common people. Whether this because the Fire Sect is
responsible, along with the Water Sect, for ensuring any large fires, a
fairly common occurrence in the crowded streets of Vorn, are kept under
control or because they are simply friendlier and less secretive is
unknown. Regardless wherever a Fire Caster goes he can normally be
assured of a hospitable welcome.<br>
<br>
Though the Fire Sect typically tries to foster good relations with the
other Sects, they are one of the Order Sect's staunchest supporters,
though whether this has more to do with the age old enmity between
them and the Guardian supporting Water Sect is not spoken about.
Suffice it to say that the Magus Council is divided and the Fire Sect
supports the stronger side.<br>
<br>
The Symbol of the Fire Sect is, Strangely, a flame.<br>

<br>
The Current Lord Fire is Kimbril FlameHand.<br>
