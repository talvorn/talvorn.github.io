<br>
The Water Sect focuses upon the power
required to cause whirlpools, tsunamis, floods and sea storms, these
forces of nature very powerful near water, but difficult to summon at a
distance. For this reason a lot of Water Casters carry a small corked
vial of water around their neck, allowing them at least some water to
work their spells with, wherever they are.<br>
</font><blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Water Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote><ul><li> <b>Force of Water</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a blue orb of
shimmering water which consumes any living tissue it touches. Acting in
effect like a Whirlpool, anything pulled into it is devoured. After
such an impact occurs, the orb continues moving; allowing it to strike
multiple targets.</i><br></font></li><li> <b>Tsunami</b><br>
<i>Utilizing this form of Forbidden Water Magic, the caster raises a
monstrous wall of water, which they then direct at a target. As the
wall of water smashes into it, thousands of pounds of pressure are
behind the strike. This force causes extreme damage to structures, and
kills lifeforms easily.</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>

<br>
The Water Sect is normally the magic of the Mermen, that race being the
only ones who are normally resident in water. However it does have a
growing following of human Casters as well, more then enough to make it
one of the more powerful Sects in the Magus Council.<br>
<br>
The Symbol of the Water Sect is a Tsunami.<br>
<br>
The Current Lady Water is Saphiria CrystalMist.<br>
