Air Magic is commonly used as
pin-point attacks, yet with a sense of style, for instance public
assassinations when the friends of the killer are required to know
exactly who killed the person. However it is also capable of summoning
up great storms and ferocious winds. This makes Air Magic very popular
with sailors, and any ships setting out for the Dawn Islands, Dragon
Isle or from Vorn to Grath would be foolish not to take  an Air Caster
along with them. Indeed many Air Sect members amass a small
fortune this way, charging extortionate fees for their services.<br>
<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Air Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Force of Air</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a white orb of
swirling wind. The inside of such an orb is incredibly violent; the
wind speed reaching greater than a Tornado's. Contact with such an orb
will literally tear through the target, as the unbelievably violent
winds act almost like a grouping of razor blades. After such an impact
occurs, the orb continues moving; allowing it to strike multiple
targets. Due to the nature of this spell, it's course is quite erratic.</i><br></li><li> <b>Hurricane</b><br>

<i>Calling on the strongest of their Sects Magics, Air Casters are able
to summon up and control the massive winds of a Hurricane. As one would
imagine, this is incredibly destructive against both life-forms as well
as structures.</i></li></ul>

<br>
It is perhaps fitting that the Air Sect should once have been
exclusively the domain of the Angels. In a rare breaking of the
normally strict Angel Hierarchy, any Angel who is gifted with magic can
be a Caster, regardless of the colour of his or her wings. The Air Casters
used to be sent to the great College of War, like the Black Winged
Angels, yet in recent times this has somewhat changed. humanity learnt
Air Magic but slowly, mostly due to the problems of summoning down
lightning bolts and not being struck by them yourself!<br>

<br>
Yet as time passed, eventually the humans became adept at the magic and
were able to teach it themselves at the Mage School. Once this
occurred, and the Angels lost their monopoly on this Magic, one of the
major strengths of that air-borne Race was also gone. Now, the Air Sect
has found alliances with the Order, and Fire sect, both of which value
it's support.<br>

The Symbol of the Air Sect is a Lightning Bolt.<br>

The Current Lord Wind is Amphytrael BlackWing.<br>
