<font size="4"><b><i>Magic Information</i></b></font><br>
<br>
The Earth Sect focus upon power over
subtlety, well able of causing earthquakes, landslides, great walls of
earth, immense canyons and worse. It is not a Sect that is known
for it's careful usage of magic, but more likely to be one that
destroys almost everything in the immediate area with the sole aim of
obliterating one objective, one person who is a threat to the Caster. Of
course this makes the Earth Sect just as effective in siege situations
as the Guardians, the two Sects often working together to breach the
walls of some rebellious Jump Gate Community and bring the Gate back
under Council jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
<font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b><br></font>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Earth Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.<ul><li> <b>Fissure</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster creates an enormous
Fissure in the ground beneath a given person or object; dropping them
into the depths of the earth, before the chasm once more seals shut.</i><br></li><li><b>Force of Earth</b><br>

<i>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a blindingly
bright orb of brownish energy which flies at an incredible velocity at
it's targets. Upon impact, the orb shatters the object or person by
sheer force, then rebounds, seeking a new target. The easiest way to
describe such a spell is to say it is a 'Life seeking, multi-shot
cannon-ball.'</i></li></ul><Br><Br>

<b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Earth Sect is the single largest collection of Mages in any power
group on Tal'Vorn. As such this gives them a good deal of weight at
Council meetings, though the current Lady Earth is generally more
inclined to simply preserve her Sects current status, rather then
pushing for more power. Indeed she has managed this through much
careful negotiation and convoluted alliances, the most important being
with the Lord Guardian, Robert LightBringer, the Lord Magus himself.
Having the protection and friendship of the Lord Magus has allowed the
Earth Sect to oust most of the Order Sect members from their city,
Karamaterra.<br>
<br>
Dwarves were the first of all the Races to use Earth Magic and use it
extensively in all their diggings, using the magics to support tunnels
until pillars can be placed, to dig deep mine shafts, to burrow through
solid granite and a thousand other things. They also use it when they
go to war, calling upon their creator to destroy their foes for them,
be it through immense landslides or the lumbering behemoth-like Earth
Elementals.<br>
<br>
The symbol of the Earth Sect, the great mark that is embossed behind
their throne in the Council Chambers, is, obviously enough, an immense
craggy mount, called the White Mountain. Not only is it the symbol of
the Earth Sect but it's depiction is also holy to the followers of the
Earth Lord, Terra.<br>

<br>
The Current Lady Earth is Merryn EarthSaviour.<br>
