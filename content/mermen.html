The Lord of the Seas and Oceans, the God of
Water in all its forms, Hydros WaveCaller is the
ruler of the underwater realms, his undisputed
domain. The youngest of Shaltars children, he
became known as the Laughing God, taking
childish joy in almost everything he encountered.
It was in this joyous way that he created the
Mermen, the only aquatic race in Tal�Vorn,
creating beings that were as at home in the ocean
as himself, or any other creature. He laughed as
he worked, and this mirthful nature is found in
the Mermen today, who worship Hydros and all
that he stands for, celebrating him in song and
action.

<br>
<b>Physical Description:</b> Mermen are designed to
live on both land and water. Gill slits to allow
them to breathe under water, and lungs to allow
them to survive on land. Strong legs and arms,
ending in long, webbed digits to maximise
movement through water with little effort, allow
them to reach speeds of 10 knots. Their spines are
more spaced out than that of other races, giving
them great flexibility and manoeuvrability in
pursuit of their prey, or fleeing from danger,
bodies smooth and free of hair except for the
dreadlock-like fins that grow like hair from their
heads.
Despite the Mermen having lungs, and
being able to survive on land, they tend to
dehydrate faster than other races, and as such are
limited by their access to water. They must also
return to water to breed, as the young require the
nutrients and minerals present in sea water in
order to develop and grow. It is not unusual for a
Merman to remain in the ocean their whole life,
never setting foot on land. Young and old often
play in the rolling breakers near islands or
coastlines, the young adolescents daring each
other to see who would run the furthest from the
water. Out of water, Mermen tend to have low
dexterity, making them appear to be clumsy at
finer motor skills, though they are quite agile
otherwise, their speed rivalling the Red
DragonLords, and their acrobatics contending
with those of the Lar�K�Leth.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Personality:</b> Mermen are inherently laid back
and relaxed, probably a social quirk that stems
from their ability to outrun everything else that
lives, as well as the fact that the oceans are far
safer then the land. They tend to get on well with
most people, but their apparent happy-go-lucky
nature can sometimes irritate.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Religion:</b> The Mermen actively worship their
god, though they are not fanatical as with some
other races. They honour Hydros in many songs,
referring to the joyous nature and caring way in
which he regards the occupants of Tal�Vorn (How
true to his nature these songs are is often
speculated, as it is well known that whilst Hydros
often answers the prayers of mortals, it is often
not expressly what they hoped for). In creating
their songs, they feel that they are labouring as
Hydros laboured with their creation, and in
respect, they will not cease to work on a song
until they believe it to be perfect. Living within
the God of the Sea�s domain, their respect for
their environment is immense, knowing that to
bring harm to the oceans would bring wrath upon
them. However, as always with the Mermen, they
do not fear retribution, they simply insure that
they do things in such a way it would be unlikely
for them to cause such harm.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Relations:</b> Mermen tend to get on effortlessly
well with most of the other Races, especially
Humans, Soulless, Fae and Elves. The hardworking Dwarves tend to find their joking and care-free attitude somewhat irritating, whilst
Anvar and DragonLords find themselves utterly
bemused by the small, laughing thing running
around them and constantly talking.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Territory:</b> The Mermen are Tal'Vorns only
sentient aquatic Race in the East. As such, they have great freedom and safety in comparison to most other. Their primary capital is name Haltimeran and is located in warm, shallow and tropical seas midway between Tal'Vorns two largest landmasses. The city was carved out of a living coral bed by the finest artisans the Mermen had. Haltimeran was once open to the sea, but due to a miscalculation by those who had designed it, the currents did not flow through the homes, and
water pooled in certain areas, becoming stale and
stagnant, having to be removed manually to avoid
the sickness that such waters caused. This was
later modified into a large dome that keeps the
water out and cycles it into air instead.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Language:</b> The Mermen have the most
pronounced accent of any of the races of
Tal�Vorn, never fast talking and always rhythmic.
It has been remarked by more than one land-farer
that the Mermen speak and act as though under
the influence of particular drugs. This observation
comes from the laid back, carefree manner that
many Mermen adopt, largely a product of the
freedom and protection they receive in their
ocean domain.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Names:</b> Mermen naming conventions have been
affected by the creatures that they live beside,
many of them being given names similar to
aquatic life. However, with Mermish nature being
as gregarious as it is, they have also been known
to adopt names from other cultures as well.
