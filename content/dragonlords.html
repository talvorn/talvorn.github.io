The DragonLords are a breed apart, a race so
completely different from anything else that
walks upright, which they cannot be thought of in
the same way. Whilst almost all of the Elder
Races are warm-blooded, bar the Mist Devils,
and Mani who do not actually have blood, the
DragonLords have only cold blood pumping
through their veins. This makes them different to
the other races in a way that is almost subconscious, as if no matter how well a DragonLord may disguise who he is. To be a DragonLord is to be a representation of their God, Shaltar the AllFather. To be a DragonLord is to die in combat, with courage and honour. To be a
DragonLord is to be a true warrior.
<br>
<br>
<b>Physical Description:</b> On the exterior,
DragonLords are no different from the other
humanoid Races, if a little taller and broader.
They have no distinguishing marks, other then,
commonly, numerous scars and other marks of
battle and can thus pass as human, Merman or
even Elven. Internally they could not be more
different. Their skeletal structure is bizarre, their
ribs cage fused into one solid plate to protect the
twin hearts that beat underneath it. Between each
heart is a ridge of bone to prevent a single attack
damaging both organs. Their lungs are tougher
and more leathery on the outside then those of
humans, with bony plates protecting them. Their
spinal column is approximately three times the
thickness of that of a human, a fact that goes a
long way into accounting for their size and bulk.
Their blood is strange, almost black, as it
is full of blood cells and anti-bodies. This gives
them great endurance and their muscles can work
long after they have been starved of oxygen,
breaking down the tissue only for it to regenerate
again. DragonLord muscles do not produce lactic
acid, nor do they suffer from stitches or recurring
injuries from past battles. Their flesh is
regenerative, and this grows more powerful as
they age, the oldest of their kind being almost
impossible to wound without magic.
DragonLords are also a highly diverse
species, with a dozen different variants, each
unique in their abilities and powers, each
descended from a different colour of Dragon.
<br>
<br>
<b>Personality:</b> DragonLords, being animalistic attimes, have few morals and even fewer fears. They know that they are strong, that Shaltar
awaits them after death, and so they fear nothing,
for death to them is not the end. However, this
lack of morals also horrifies the other Races that
the DragonLords meet. DragonLords think
nothing of incest or cannibalism, viewing the
former as simply mating with an available
DragonLord and the latter as a form of
emergency food. This has lead to horror stories
about DragonLords being told amongst the
human population, of how DragonLords devour
children and the elderly. In all actuality this
would never happen, DragonLords viewing the
other races as inferior and not worth devouring.
<br>
<br>
<b>Religion:</b> DragonLords are not outwardly
particularly religious. They do not tend to pray
and very rarely hold ceremonies in honour of
their God and creator, Shaltar the AllFather.
DragonLords know for a fact that Shaltar exists
and they believe that every act of courage and
valour that they commit is a prayer to Shaltar, a
battle cry in the Gods name. They know that,
should they die well, they will ascend to sit
beside their God and so they strive to do exactly
that, die superbly. However, in spite of this, there
are a number of so called 'Battle-Prayers' which
are chanted by a group of DragonLords before a
dangerous combat, as they believe that it will
bring Shaltar's blessing down upon them.
<br>
<br>
<b>Relations:</b> DragonLords hate Humanity for
stealing land where DragonLords once lived and
for the devastation done to the DragonLords
during the Great War. Though it is against the
Humans that the DragonLords spend most of
their venom, they have been known to have
respect for some of the other Races. Anvar and
Dwarves the DragonLords have warred against
and fought beside on more then one occasion, the
same being true of the Elves. The DragonLords
view the Fae as useful, if timid, creatures and the
Mermen as irritating distractions. Soulless,
however, the DragonLords view as something of
a quandary. Their extreme similarity to Humans
inspires hatred, yet their courage and steadfast
nature demands respect.
<br>
<br>
<b>Territory:</b> DragonLords live in close-knit clans, generally of no more then a dozen individuals stemming from a single pair of adults. Once they are old enough to look after themselves, the DragonLords will divide their clan apart. They tend to congregate in specific colour based clans, with different types of DragonLord living in differing areas. As such Blue DragonLords favour the warm oceans, Whites the northern ice, Reds the flat plains, Bronze the deep deserts and Coppers the high mountains and so on.
<br>
<br>
<b>Language:</b> DragonLords, like most Draconic
creatures such as Dragons, Hydras and Wyverns,
speak a form of Draconic. They also tend to have
a command of Common in order to trade and gain
goods from the other Races.
<br>
<br> 
<b>Names:</b> DragonLord names are very important to them, especially titles. They tend to gather them avidly, using their own titles extensively. They also refer to other people by their titles just as much as their names. As an example of a full
DragonLord title: Alexis DragonRider, Son of
Silofan and Vralic, Nemesis of Liam HeartBreaker . . . (and so on) As for actual names,
DragonLords favour more impressive sounding
names. 
For example: Male: Alexis, Draco, Drake,
Jxom, Oriss, Siac, Sintai, Woir
Female: Arwen, Ifba, Letanoda, Melanie, Nalhin,
Osath, Rhyghamos.
