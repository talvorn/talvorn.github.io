Angels are the Children of Aeros, the God of Flight and 
Valour. They are brave, noble and self-sacrificing, functioning 
in an almost unique meritocracy within their restrictive caste system. 
Individuals in the Angelic cities have the option of becoming 
indentured servants, serving other Angels and the community 
for a period of time in exchange for wealth and preferential 
treatment at the end of their indenture period.
<br /> <br /> <strong>Physical Description:</strong> 
A Race both tall and beautiful the Angels are
blessed with large, bird like wings spreading
from their shoulder blades. A dim halo of light,
enough to wreath their features in colour but not
enough to illuminate, shines out from their flesh
and gives them a beautiful, unearthly quality.
<br><br>The Golden Winged Angels are the
aristocracy, leaders and commanders of the Race,
both wise and noble. The Blue Winged Angels 
are highly dextrous and skilled at a wide range of
arts and crafts making them superb artisans. The
Third Breed, the Grey Winged, was granted the
agility of tongue and eloquence so vital in a
Breed of diplomats. The White Winged Angels
have been gifted the intelligence required to
teach, to build, to plant and farm. Finally the
Black Winged Angels are crafted to be warriors,
much stronger than the others of their Race.
<br><br>No Angel is capable of giving birth to
another. Whilst more than capable of having
sexual relations, it is impossible for a female
Angel to conceive. Instead an Angel is brought
into being, fully formed, several hundred metres
above the surface of one of the Angel Cities. Noone
can predict when these Angels will be
created, but may Angelic families tend to adopt
these new arrivals as a form of children. Though
physically adults, most of the new Angels
possess only the knowledge of the average five
year old human child. They develop
exceptionally quickly mentally however usually
learning to read within a matter of hours.
<br><br>An Angel can typically expect to live for
nearly sixty years. Though less time than humans
and definitely less than many of Tal'Vorn’s other
Races, an Angel will spend every moment of
their lives in the peak of physical health.
<br /> <br /> <strong>Personality:</strong> An Angel’s personality typically varies by
Breed, though they all share a number of
common traits. Though several of Tal’Vorn’s
Races can fly, none of them possess the true
freedom on the air that Angels do. This perceived
superiority can affect the attitudes of a lot of
Aeros’ Children. Most of them however, show a
distinct degree of acceptance of the status quo
and an unwillingness to accept rapid change.
This is mostly because their culture is designed
so that each Breed of Angel is very clear about
their roles in society and thus very clear about
their role within their Breed.<br><br>
However, not every Angel is as accepting
of their roles. Members of the Sects are
exempted from the legal requirements of their
Race and are able to pursue any number of
interests and duties. However, if an Angel is not a
member of a Sect and attempts to be too blatant
in breaching his Breeds responsibilities, then
they risk being stripped of their wings and exiled
to a far southern city called Crimlis.
<br /> <br /> <strong>Relations:</strong> Angels get on best with the other, more
martial Races, such as DragonLords or Anvar.
They have little time for the laid-back attitudes
of the Mermen and view the Soulless-Born as not
much more than dangerous abominations. Fae
have a special place in the affections of the
Angels, due to the Children of Javersith helping
to save the Angels from a plague many
generations ago. Angels actually reserve
comment on Humanity. Though the Humans are
most definitely invaders, they have done little to
affect the day to day lives of the Children of
Aeros.
<br /> <br /> <strong>Territory:</strong> The Angels control the single largest
independent empire on Tal’Vorn. Extending the
entire width of the Great Continent, the Angels
exert dominion over every mountain in the
Angel’s Peaks. This includes five large cities and
twelve Jump Gate Communities, as well as
extensive populations of Angels in each of
Tal’Vorns other major cities.
<br /> <br /> <strong>Language:</strong> Anvar speak a simple language
named after themselves, Anvar. The language
itself is supposed to have been taught to them by
the God Solar Himself, though given the Sun
Gods lack of interest in the mortals of Tal'Vorn,
this seems unlikely. What is true, however, is that
many of the greater fire creatures, such as
Elementals, speak the language as well. The
Anvar themselves view the language as holy,
making all of their prayers in it. Most of them
typically know Common as well, in order to
facilitate converting others.
<br /> <br /> <strong>Names:</strong> Angelic names are typically quite
short, though there are exceptions, and often
feature a ‘us’ or ‘a’ final syllable. As Angels are
not really born so much as brought into
existence, many of them eventually choose their
own name. <br><br>For example: Male: Atellus, Brutus, Canus, Hannibal,
Justinus, Labeo, Malleolus.<br>
Female: Annalis, Bassa, Crispina, Eleanor,
Helva, Imperiosa, Lucia.<br /> <br />

<i>We have no interest in your war, DragonLord, no interest
because we are unassailable. Let the humans come and we will show them
how futile it is to attack a Race born in the skies!</i><br>
