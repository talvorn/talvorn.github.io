  <title>Tal'Vorn - Welcome to the world</title> <center> <img src="http://www.tal-vorn.com/images/races/Fae.jpg" /></center> <br /><br /> <br />


The Fae are both kind and caring. They genuinely
love all living things and take a delight in seeing
new wonders upon Tal'Vorn. They are almost
childlike in their innocence and yet show
remarkable matter-of-factness in dealing with
even the most horrific of injuries. They loathe
war and long for peace, long for a time when they
will no longer be needed, when the other Races
and humans will no longer flood to their Houses
of Healing for help.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Physical Description:</strong> The Fae are blessed with
the delicate butterfly or insect-like wings that
adorn the back of Javersith, the Goddess of
Mercy and Sorrow, herself.. Though physically
the same size and build as humans, the Fae are
given the kindness that only the Goddess of
Mercy can truly share, their features seemingly
always either smiling, or crying, hardly ever
showing any signs of anger or hatred. Naturally
the Fae are more then capable of harsh action
when it is required, for Javersith is the Goddess
of Mercy, not kindness or forgiveness and mercy
is not always gentle.
Their features are typically Elder in
construction, seemingly human-like at first
glance, but subtle differences becoming obvious.
Fae skin has a slight sheen to it, and their eyes are
slightly larger then is normal in humans. Their
skin and hair colours also have a broader range
then humans. Skin tones can vary from the
human usual to pale blues and greys. Hair colours
come in numerous different shades of red, brown,
blue and green, but typically are bright and
obvious colours.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Personality:</strong> As a Race, the Fae are unique in that
they show no signs of favouritism amidst any of
the other Races, they never choose sides or refuse
to heal anyone. Indeed the Healer Sect is one of
the only Tal'Vorn Sects with a majority nonhuman
population, the Sect mostly consisting of Fae. From a young age, the Race is given instinctive knowledge of how to sooth pain and repair physical and mental damage, as well as cast spells that do the same thing.
They are stoic in the face of great hardship, especially when their services are required and most especially when an innocent is injured. The horrors of war and wounds hold little terror for the Fae, trained as they are from a relatively young age to accept and deal with injuries. After Javersith finally left Tal'Vorn, the Fae continued the Goddess' work, striving to save whoever needed them, at any time that they were needed. Yet even the Fae are not totally innocent in their past. They fought against humanity in the Great War after hearing the DragonKing Vralic speak of what the humans had done to innocent DragonLords.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Religion:</strong> The Fae are relatively simple in their
devotion to the Goddess Javersith. There are
several temples to the Merciful One in all of the
major cities, and most Jump Gate Communities
will have at least a small shrine, typically within
the home of the communities Healer Sect
representative. Javersith does not demand
excessive services in her name, though many
Humans request a passage from her holy texts to
be read during marriage ceremonies as it is
believed to bring the couple good luck and help to
stave off the Sorrow that Javersith is the mistress
of.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Relations:</strong> Of the most common Races of
Tal'Vorn, there are only two that the Fae will
absolutely refuse to heal; the soul-drinking Mist
Devils and the vicious, slave-taking Pravaii.
Javersith herself forbid the aiding of the Mist
Devils, children of the Corrupter, as the Soul-
Drinkers would simply slaughter the Fae once the
work was finished. The Fae themselves have
chosen not to heal the Pravaii as the Fallen have time and again repaid the kindness with
slavery, barbarity and sacrifice in the name of the
Slaughter God, Killar the Mad.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Territory:</strong> Fae have no cities or great towns of
their own. Instead they live in the villages, cities
and places of the other Races, earning their keep
with their healing skills. Many of them are
members of the Healer Sect. As the Sect is
required to provide a representative for every
Jump Gate Community under the control of the
Magus Council, many Fae find their homes in the
small villages that act as waystations on the
journeys of others.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Language:</strong> Because of their extreme level of
integration into the other Races cultures, the Fae
actually have no language of their own, simply
speaking in either common, or the language of
the community they have lived in for the longest.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Names:</strong> Fae naming conventions depend entirely
upon where they were born and live. Fae in Elven
communes will favour the Immortals names,
whilst Fae in Drazzahezz will typically use the
Dwarven naming methods.

wound. Yes, that's it. Now don't let go. Ahhh, good. See, wasn't that
hard was it?&quot;</em><br />

after it's temporary bout as a makeshift healer, or how badly it's
brethren mocked it, are unknown.</body>
