Holy Magic is the human version of Light Magic. However, beyond this, it also contains elements of what might be considered Guardian, Order and even Healer Magics. Able to defend, attack and heal the Magic is very powerful, but still not the final word in a magical conflict. It lacks the raw destructive force of true Guardian Magic, the ability to heal almost any wound of the Healer Sect and the sheer crowd control capabilities of the Order magics. However it is more flexible and more adaptable of any of the three alone.<br>

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Holy Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. </blockquote>

<ul><li> <b>Holy Word</b><br>
<i>The might of Solar strikes down any and all within ear-shot of the caster. However, this is a spell of last resort, for Solar strikes down ANYONE within ear-shot, including the caster's allies and the caster himself.</i><br></li><li> <br>

<br>
Holy Magic is intrinsically linked to the Light Magic of the Anvar, having it's 
creative roots firmly lodged in that type of Magic. However they have since 
gone down it's own route. Recent conflicts have served only to strength the 
power of Holy Magic, for it is nothing if not adaptable and one of its primary
abilities is to incorperate all kinds of spells into it's casting capabilities.<br>

<br>

The Symbol of Holy Magic is a Burning Heart, one of Solar's symbols.<br>
