Illusion Magic is exceedingly difficult to learn, let alone master. However, 
it's spells are some of the most powerful in the world. With the ability to 
make anything appear, anything look like anything else, and for it, for the 
duration of the spell, to be absolutely true, is not an ability to be 
underestimated. Illusion Mages, though rare, tend to be able to fit into any 
community as their magic can be adapted to look like any Sect, Elder or 
Western Magic in existance.<br>

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>

Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Illusion Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to weild.</blockquote><ul><li> 

<b>Truth's End</b><br>

<i>Everything that the victim sees becomes opposite. Everything they do seems to have an oppoing effect. So if they try to jump, they will fall down. Should they push something, then it will be pulled towards them instead. And should they try to throw a magic spell at the Illusion Mage . . . </i><br></li><li>

<b><i><font size="4">Magic Type Political Information</font></i></b><br>

<br>
Illusion Magic was originally developed by a Northar, though the ability has since leaked to the East and to the Southar. Thus an individual Illusion Mage decides his or her own political alignment, as there is no organized group of Illusion Casters. Indeed most Illusionists seem to pass their knowledge onto one or two select students and thats it, rather then banding together. Why this is, isn't clear, though it might have something to do with the possibly leathal effects of multiple Illusion spells being cast in the same general area.<br>

The Symbol of Illusion Magic is a Swirl of Colours.<br>
