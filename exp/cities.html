<center><b>Solgaran</center></b></br>

Formed from a single piece of stone, Solgaran is a beauty to behold, magnificent and awe-inspiring. Even for those who do not worship Solar it is said to be a moving sight. Almost a mile wide at it's base, the tower reaches out towards the sun like an almighty finger, it's razor-sharp tip more then three miles above the surface. This makes it the tallest freestanding structure on the planet. Around the tower is clustered the largest of the Anvar fortress-temples, Islara, named after the Island itself. <br>
<br>
The population of Islara is almost exclusively Anvar and Northars. However recent intelligence reports gleaned by the Magus Council and circulated to the Order and Guardian Sects suggests that Lilar Herself has visited the Temple. Even ignoring the pomp and ceremony that must have surrounded such a visit, it is curious as to why the Goddess of Vengence would wish to see the landing point of her Divine Uncle. Anvar sources and certains texts found in the Vorn City libary indicate that it may have been to awaken the Venai Ravna buried underneath Islara. But Venai Ravna are known to look favourably upon Anvar, and indeed the Northars. This may not bode well for the Magus Council.<br>
<br>
<center><b>Larlia</center></b><br>
<br>

One bastion stands between the bestial hordes of the South and the stalwart inhabitants of the North. Spanning the whole expanse of the single passageway through the Giant’s Bones is Larlia, with its eminent vanguard erected at the southern neck of the Giant’s Axe, categorically denying all access to the beasts and corrupt humans. Its walls are now plated with the alloy of which was once comprised the hull of the Northar’s ship, and the once time-lost High Technology is now an integral part of the fortress-city’s defenses. Day and night, sentinels manning the legendary PTAU’s patrol the outer walls, on the lookout for incoming hostiles. Within fortified bunkers, Anvar and Northar alike stand their ground, readied and armed with the combined might of Solar’s magic and advanced weaponry. Larlia is nigh on impenetrable, and only in the direst of contingencies would it ever fall.<br>
<br>

The most advanced city of Tal’Vorn, however, fails to impress in terms of commodities. Being a military-driven metropolis, there is little to no leeway for private facilities: all food establishments are strategically situated throughout the city to minimize waste and optimize efficient distribution. At most, one could find recreation in card games, but entertainment has been strictly reduced to the bare minimum. Residential areas are farther away from the southern walls, built with square efficiency and utterly lacking in artistic designs and innovative architecture, showing a bland preference for the cubic and chrome-hued. Still, temples are numerous within Larlia’s walls, for religious zeal and faith are predominant aspects of the Alliance’s customs.<br>
<br>

<center><b>Gar</center></b><br>
<br>

At first a humble fishing village beyond Rilvarinistara’s northernmost coast, actually afloat over the Suban River, Gar is now the largest, most prevalent port city in existence. The foundations of the ‘floating’ city are a highly stable and solid structure of wooden buttresses and piles, and all edifices are connected with intertwining paths constructed with tightly-secured lumber. The sheer size of Gar’s residential area is something to behold, but even greater is the enormity of northward sectors, turned into cyclopean docks adapted for all types of seafarers, the piers adjusted for the mooring of any ship, favoring the mercantile value of overseas trade. In the easternmost sectors of Gar can be found the best of shipwrights, whereas most of the central and western divisions are occupied by merchants and the residential area.<br>
<br>

When compared to the dull efficiency of the earthbound Larlia, Gar is a most colorful spot that, with its abundance of trades and the diversity of its civic activities, as well as the reasonable ethnic variety that comes with the status of port city, allows a highly hospitable ambiance to reign. One must not be mislead into thinking that, being such an open lieu of comfort, Gar would be lenient in its security. The truth is quite the opposite: though laxer than that of Larlia, Gar has the means to engage in naval warfare and is in possession of advanced armament and a legion of able-bodied Northars, ready for battle.<br>
<br>

<center><b>Solim</center></b><br>
<br>

Nestled in between the drainage basins of the Ner River is Solim, city of Worship. It was built to accommodate the growing numbers of Solar’s followers, and is officiously the capital of the Alliance. Colossal temples spawn throughout the cityscape, not unlike the gleaming specks upon a celestial map. They are so numerous that it becomes increasingly difficult to find any building not consecrated to the Sun God, if there are any.<br>
