Light Magic is the oldest form of Magic known to the Anvar and is said to
have been learnt in a feverish wish to be more like Solar. It is the reason
for the schism that seperated the Western Anvar from the rest of their 
race on the Eastern landmasses. Light Magic typically appears as blindig 
lights, or energy that burns like the sun.<br>

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>

Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Light Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to weild.</blockquote><ul><li>

<b>Force of Light</b><br>

<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a white orb of
blinding light. The inside of such an orb is incredibly hot; the
temperature approaching fusion levels, and the light emitted from it truely blinding.. Contact with such an orb
will literally burn through the target, as the unbelievably violent
energies act almost like a grouping of drill. After such an impact
occures, the orb continues moving; allowing it to strike multiple
targets. Due to the nature of this spell, it's course is quite erratic.</i><br></li><li> 

<b>Solar's Gaze</b><br>

<i>Unleashing the wrath of Solar upon the ground, the Light Mage causes a powerful beam of energy to decend from the heavens to strike a particular spot. The beam happens to be half a kilometer across.</i></li></ul>

<br>
Light Magic is the magic from which both Holy and Illusion were developed. As such it maintains good connections with both these branches of magic, though only Holy Magic can truely be called an ally. With it's roots in the power fo Solar, and embued as it is with the might of Solgaran, Light Magic is both powerful and uncontrolled. This makes it a prime antithesis to both the Order and the Guardians, a situation only increased by the blossoming war between West and East. <br>

The Symbol of the Light Sect is the Blazing Sun.<br>
<br>

The most powerful Light Magic user is the Anvar Paladin, Ib.<br>
