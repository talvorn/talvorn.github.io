Your Class chosen, you have made the decision as to where you belong in
the chaos of combat.

Now that we know what Class you wish to belong to, you can make the
choice as to which Sect to join. Pick wisely\! They are different in
more than their abilities. Each is a military organisation with needs
and desires that you should carefully consider should you wish to be
promoted and attain greater power.

## **Step Three; Sect**

**Air**

  -

      -
        A singular, pinpoint strike epitomises the Air Sect and whilst
        their damage might not be the highest any Sect is capable, their
        range is beyond compare. If you are within the line of sight of
        an Air Caster, then you are within striking distance. Crackling
        thunderbolts, gusts of howling wind, torrential floods of rain,
        concealing mist and, should you truly wish to make a brutal
        point, an immensely damaging lightning strike out of a clear,
        cloudless blue sky. Singular targets are the Air Sect's victim
        of choice and though they possess some area of effect spells,
        these are more limited in scope and less focused in usage. -

        foes\!](GoldAngelAir "wikilink")

**Fire**

  -

      -
        The aftermath of an angry Fire Secter is obvious; a landscape of
        scorched and charred bodies and buildings. Though reasonably
        short ranged, almost all of the Fire Sect's spells are explosive
        in nature and horrifying in effect. Few foes can stand in the
        face of being set alight and many will flee instead of face
        taking more damage. Favouring heavy axes for when the brutality
        of melee calls for it, many Fire Secters enter combat with laugh
        on their lips, raining destruction indiscriminately around them,
        much to their allies dismay. Despite this, because the Casters
        also work hard in urban environments to protect buildings from
        mundane flames, the Sect remains unfailingly popular with the
        Mundanes. - [The crackle of flames will be the very last thing
        they hear.](GoldAngelFire "wikilink")

**Ice**

  -

      -
        Layering their flesh with armour of ice, and freezing their foes
        to the very marrow, the Casters of the Ice Sect are incredibly,
        horrifyingly dangerous at point-blank range. Their spells tend
        to lose potency over distance as the slowly melting ice loses
        its razor sharpness but in close they are second to none at
        absolute death. Experts in the use of abalative layers of magic
        for short term protection, this skill allows them to get in
        close where the Ice Sect reaps the lives of their foes like the
        scythes its Casters favour. Frozen limbs and - [Their deaths
        will be painless, instant and inevitable as the coming of
        winter.](GoldAngelIce "wikilink")
