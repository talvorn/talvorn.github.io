The Air Sect was formed long before the arrival of humanity upon
Tal'Vorn. Rumoured to have been gifted to the [Angels](Angel "wikilink")
by Aeros the Sky Lord Himself, the magic focuses primarily upon
pin-point strikes of devastating power at long range against single
targets. As the Gods of Tal'Vorn were once exceedingly active, and even
today have been known to make personal appearances, the concept that Air
Magic could have been personally gifted to the
[Legions](Angel "wikilink") is not actually that far fetched. The God of
Valour has not been personally active upon the world in several
centuries however and so His creations have evolved and modified the
magic to their own purposes in the years since.

The Sect is naturally capable of calling down devastating hurricanes,
lightning storms and blasts of wind, but such things are considered
pointless displays of might that are beneath the majesty of the Air
Sect. A single strike of overwhelming force and precision is considered
the most acceptable usage of the Storm. An Air Caster can call upon
active weather fronts or simply create their own lightning from scratch,
though the former is considerably more powerful. Because of this the Air
Sect has developed several spells designed to create storm-clouds in
order to increase the damage of their spells in otherwise calm
conditions, though doing so is considered a sign of weakness and
desperation.

Many of the Air Sect are also assigned to military vessels in both the
ocean going and airship fleets, ensuring good weather and fair winds in
the name of safety. Though doing this when commanded by their Sects is
one thing, some Air Casters make a good living doing the same job for
merchant vessels. Such mercenary activities are considered thoroughly
beneath the majority of the Sect however. Though it is officially
frowned upon, the Air Sect have been known to accept contracts for
nothing more or less than actual assassinations, especially by Casters
of the lower Ranks. Though Casters are well paid compared to Mundanes,
assassination generally pays a ridiculous sum of money, especially when
its required to be as obvious as an Air Sect strike. Little is as
effective at making a statement as a political opponent being struck
down by a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.

## **Opinion of Other Sects**

**Air** - "They're not called the [Nobles](Air_Sect "wikilink")
for nothing. Think they are better than everyone, but that just 
means they have more belongings to rifle through."

**Dark** - "Now these are genuine, real-deal baddies. Give them
a kicking, but do it from a safe place, yeah?"

**Earth** - "Stay off the ground or yer likely to end up face first
on it. Nice enough if they don't think yer picking their
pocket though."

**Fire** - "Bloody [Pyromaniacs](Fire_Sect "wikilink"). Useful 
against a mob of folks though, so try to make friends."

**Guardian** - "Our much vaunted 'patrons'. More fool if they think
making our dealings semi-legal will stop us from making the
most of it."

**Healer** - "Anazubg folk, truly are. Nothing like the soothing
touch of the [Kindly](Healer_Sect "wikilink") after you've
had your head kicked in by a [Stripeback](The_Order_Sect "wikilink")."

**Ice** - "Almost as reliable as we are! Still doesn't mean
you should trust 'em any further than you could throw 'em."

**Life** - "They mostly do in the wilds what we do in the cities,
so game has to respect game. Bit weird though."

**Psychic** - "[Mindbuzzers](Psychic_Sect "wikilink") don't like it
when you hum really annoying songs to yourself inside your own head. 
Which makes it obviously hilarious and smart to do."

**Research** - "Grapping hooks, automatic lockpicks, flash
bangs, the list of toys the [Grey](Research_Sect "wikilink")
make for us is almost unending and all equally fabulous. If
a little unstable . . ."

**The Order** - "Dodge, avoid, mislead and generally stay the
hell away from the [Stripebacks](The_Order_Sect "wikilink") if
you like your fingers to remain attached. Just don't fully
like to them either, they take it personally."

**Universe** - "Oh the shenanigans we could pull if we could only 
get the [Dreamers](Universe_Sect "wikilink") onboard with our
schemes. Alas they are far too distracted."

**Warrior** - "They have more in common with us than they might
want to agree with. Ultimately the [Bold](Warrior_Sect "wikilink")
make for an excellent meatshield to hide behind."

**Water** - "Some of their magic is real useful when it comes
to making us even more evasive, but just be careful you do not
upset them. Your footing can get real uncertain at the wrong
moment."

## **Sect Physrep**

**Colour**; **Primary Physrep.** - None, though the Knaves are smart enough to avoid wearing all black.

**Symbol** - None. Not being a true Sect, they have no unifying symbol.

**Tattoo** - The Knaves are wise enough not to mark themselves out for easy identification.

**Clothing** - Like most Arcanists, the Air Sect prefer to keep their
hands free in order to manage the more complex gestures required of
their aggressive spells and also to ensure that their closer range
attacks are not accidentally earthed into their own clothing. There is a
distinct similarity to more traditional Angelic clothing as well,
causing togas and stola to be common amongst members of the Sect,
regardless of their racial origin.

**Weapon Preferences** - Being formed from the magics used traditionally
by the [Angelic](Angel "wikilink") inhabitants of Tal'Vorn, the members
of the Air Sect are traditionally trained and drilled in the usage of
the long spear favoured by the Children of
[Aeros](Aeros_the_Valorous "wikilink"). It can be used both in practical
defence and also as a literal lightning rod, useful for drawing down the
few close range spells this Sect has access to.

**Roleplaying Effects** - Air Sect casters, especially Angels, are
taught that they are magically and morally superior to most of the other
Sects and are known to act it. They dislike getting involved in close
combat, preferring to hang back from the lines and make use of the full
range of their powerful spells. They get on well with members of the
Order, Fire and Universe spells, with distinct rivalries with the Ice,
Guardian, Warrior and especially Earth Sect. They enjoy displaying their
power and superiority and often dress to impress, using the bright
yellow of lightning throughout their clothing and accessories.

## **Titles**

Air Sect titles most often make reference to the more aggressive aspects
of their magic, focusing upon storms, lightning, thunder and so forth,
though some prefer less ominous methods of referring to themselves.

## **Patron Deity**

Being primarily composed of Angels and using a magic created by that
self-same Race, the Air Sect has a definite leaning towards the worship
of Aeros, the Sky Lord. The Stormcallers focus less upon Aeros' aspect
as the God of Valour and more upon His dominion over Flight and Air
itself, invoking His name when attempting complex rituals, embarking
upon dangerous sea voyages, before a potentially lethal mission or
simply as part of daily life.
