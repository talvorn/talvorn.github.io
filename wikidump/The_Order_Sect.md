The Air Sect was formed long before the arrival of humanity upon
Tal'Vorn. Rumoured to have been gifted to the [Angels](Angel "wikilink")
by Aeros the Sky Lord Himself, the magic focuses primarily upon
pin-point strikes of devastating power at long range against single
targets. As the Gods of Tal'Vorn were once exceedingly active, and even
today have been known to make personal appearances, the concept that Air
Magic could have been personally gifted to the
[Legions](Angel "wikilink") is not actually that far fetched. The God of
Valour has not been personally active upon the world in several
centuries however and so His creations have evolved and modified the
magic to their own purposes in the years since.

The Sect is naturally capable of calling down devastating hurricanes,
lightning storms and blasts of wind, but such things are considered
pointless displays of might that are beneath the majesty of the Air
Sect. A single strike of overwhelming force and precision is considered
the most acceptable usage of the Storm. An Air Caster can call upon
active weather fronts or simply create their own lightning from scratch,
though the former is considerably more powerful. Because of this the Air
Sect has developed several spells designed to create storm-clouds in
order to increase the damage of their spells in otherwise calm
conditions, though doing so is considered a sign of weakness and
desperation.

Many of the Air Sect are also assigned to military vessels in both the
ocean going and airship fleets, ensuring good weather and fair winds in
the name of safety. Though doing this when commanded by their Sects is
one thing, some Air Casters make a good living doing the same job for
merchant vessels. Such mercenary activities are considered thoroughly
beneath the majority of the Sect however. Though it is officially
frowned upon, the Air Sect have been known to accept contracts for
nothing more or less than actual assassinations, especially by Casters
of the lower Ranks. Though Casters are well paid compared to Mundanes,
assassination generally pays a ridiculous sum of money, especially when
its required to be as obvious as an Air Sect strike. Little is as
effective at making a statement as a political opponent being struck
down by a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.

Sol ChainBreaker, Order Sect Mage First Class

## **Opinion of Other Sects**

**Air** - "One of our closest allies, inpired and drawing their
ranks primarily from the orderly Angelic Cities. A prime example
of how a Sect should act in the face of law and justice."

**Dark** - "Only the harshest punishments await those foolish
enough to join the ranks of the [Traitors](Dark_Sect "wikilink").
Punishments we do not dicuss amidst those not part of the 
[Arrow](The_Order_Sect "wikilink")."

**Earth** - "Eventually the [Diggers](Earth_Sect "wikilink")
will realise that this project of independence they are 
attempting in [Karamaterra](Karamaterra "wikilink") is as
disaster waiting to happen. At that point we will be delighted
to lend our asssistance."

**Fire** - "Though more chaotic than we would prefer our allies to be,
the [Blazing](Fire_Sect "wikilink") do an important job in 
their role as firefighters and their dedication to that is 
second to none."

**Guardian** - "The [Hidebound](Guardian_Sect "wikilink") are fools.
Stubborn, unmoving, traditionalist fools."

**Healer** - "On occasion we are forced to include the terms "no
magical healing' when meting out punishments for crimes
committed. The [Kindly](Healer_Sect "wikilink") . . . are not
impressed by this. We do not mean to increase their worklord,
but needs must."

**Ice** - "We do not begrudge the [Obstinate](Guardian_Sect "wikilink")
their alliance with the [Fickle](Ice_Sect "wikilink"), if only
because the Ice Sect are as reliable as the snowflake that forms
their symbol. This power-block will collapse like snow under a
summer sun."

**Knave** - "The concept of actual thieves operating alongside
legitimate members of the Sects, naturally, does not sit well.
More annoying than that however, is that since their legalisation
crime really has actually fallen slightly. Absurd."

**Life** - "So long as whatever crimes they commit are done out
in the wilderness, they remain not our problem. Frankly speaking,
any group of people we can say that about is pleasant novelty."

**Psychic** - "We work well with the Third Eye in matters of
interrogation and investigation, but be cautious of them anyway.
A group capable of modifying your memory should always be suspect
from a law-enforcement perspective."

**Research** - "The majority of the idiocy the 
[Mad](Research_Sect "wikilink") get up to does not fall within the remit
of crimes we are responsible for punishing, unless being a pack of
absolute bloody fools is illegal. Mind you, the amount of times they blow
themselves up, they are probably all guilty of Assault on a Sect Member."

**Universe** - "Trying to collar one of the [Dreamers](Universe_Sect "wikilink")
is an utter nightmare. How do so many heavily laden carts suddenly
emerge from blind alleyways right into our path?"

**Warrior** - "As we guard the core of the cities, so too do the
[Bold](Warrior_Sect "wikilink") defend the edges. Even if they are closer
to the [Stubborn](Guardian_Sect "wikilink") than we would like, they
are generally brave and reliable folk. Further, at least the few
crimes they commit are usually due to off-duty foolishness
and easily resolved."

**Water** - "So long as don't find out what the 
[Swimmers](Water_Sect "wikilink") are up to under the water,
we will continue to have no issue with them."

## **Sect Physrep**

**Colour**; **Primary Physrep.** - Black with a broad white trim.

**Symbol** - The Upright Arrow

**Tattoo** - The symbol of The Order Sect is placed upon the *Palm of the Right Hand.*

**Clothing** - Like most Arcanists, the Air Sect prefer to keep their
hands free in order to manage the more complex gestures required of
their aggressive spells and also to ensure that their closer range
attacks are not accidentally earthed into their own clothing. There is a
distinct similarity to more traditional Angelic clothing as well,
causing togas and stola to be common amongst members of the Sect,
regardless of their racial origin.

**Weapon Preferences** - Being formed from the magics used traditionally
by the [Angelic](Angel "wikilink") inhabitants of Tal'Vorn, the members
of the Air Sect are traditionally trained and drilled in the usage of
the long spear favoured by the Children of
[Aeros](Aeros_the_Valorous "wikilink"). It can be used both in practical
defence and also as a literal lightning rod, useful for drawing down the
few close range spells this Sect has access to.

**Roleplaying Effects** - Air Sect casters, especially Angels, are
taught that they are magically and morally superior to most of the other
Sects and are known to act it. They dislike getting involved in close
combat, preferring to hang back from the lines and make use of the full
range of their powerful spells. They get on well with members of the
Order, Fire and Universe spells, with distinct rivalries with the Ice,
Guardian, Warrior and especially Earth Sect. They enjoy displaying their
power and superiority and often dress to impress, using the bright
yellow of lightning throughout their clothing and accessories.

## **Titles**

Air Sect titles most often make reference to the more aggressive aspects
of their magic, focusing upon storms, lightning, thunder and so forth,
though some prefer less ominous methods of referring to themselves.

## **Nicknames**

  - The Arrorw
  - The Just
  - Totalitarians (insult)
  - Brutes (insult)
  - Law Marked
  - Stripebacks (Vorn City Slang)

## **Patron Deity**

Being primarily composed of Angels and using a magic created by that
self-same Race, the Air Sect has a definite leaning towards the worship
of Aeros, the Sky Lord. The Stormcallers focus less upon Aeros' aspect
as the God of Valour and more upon His dominion over Flight and Air
itself, invoking His name when attempting complex rituals, embarking
upon dangerous sea voyages, before a potentially lethal mission or
simply as part of daily life.
