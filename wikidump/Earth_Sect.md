The Air Sect was formed long before the arrival of humanity upon
Tal'Vorn. Rumoured to have been gifted to the [Angels](Angel "wikilink")
by Aeros the Sky Lord Himself, the magic focuses primarily upon
pin-point strikes of devastating power at long range against single
targets. As the Gods of Tal'Vorn were once exceedingly active, and even
today have been known to make personal appearances, the concept that Air
Magic could have been personally gifted to the
[Legions](Angel "wikilink") is not actually that far fetched. The God of
Valour has not been personally active upon the world in several
centuries however and so His creations have evolved and modified the
magic to their own purposes in the years since.

The Sect is naturally capable of calling down devastating hurricanes,
lightning storms and blasts of wind, but such things are considered
pointless displays of might that are beneath the majesty of the Air
Sect. A single strike of overwhelming force and precision is considered
the most acceptable usage of the Storm. An Air Caster can call upon
active weather fronts or simply create their own lightning from scratch,
though the former is considerably more powerful. Because of this the Air
Sect has developed several spells designed to create storm-clouds in
order to increase the damage of their spells in otherwise calm
conditions, though doing so is considered a sign of weakness and
desperation.

Many of the Air Sect are also assigned to military vessels in both the
ocean going and airship fleets, ensuring good weather and fair winds in
the name of safety. Though doing this when commanded by their Sects is
one thing, some Air Casters make a good living doing the same job for
merchant vessels. Such mercenary activities are considered thoroughly
beneath the majority of the Sect however. Though it is officially
frowned upon, the Air Sect have been known to accept contracts for
nothing more or less than actual assassinations, especially by Casters
of the lower Ranks. Though Casters are well paid compared to Mundanes,
assassination generally pays a ridiculous sum of money, especially when
its required to be as obvious as an Air Sect strike. Little is as
effective at making a statement as a political opponent being struck
down by a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.

## **Representative Within Haven**

Ping

## **Opinion of Other Sects**

**Air** - "Our inability to hurt each other does not garner respect.
The [Nobles](Air_Sect "wikilink") are nothing like as superior as
they portray themselves and their arrogance is frankly irritating."

**Dark** - "We were part of the force sent in to break the [Decieved](Dark_Sect "wikilink")
during the Illaria Purges. Evidently our job is not done, so finish the task."

**Fire** - "Naturally in any location as warm as the [City of Temples](Karamaterra "wikilink"),
having [Firestarters](Fire_Sect "wikilink") on hand to put out any
wildfires is exceedingly helpful."

**Guardian** - "Their willingness to assist in policing [Karamaterra](Karamaterra "wikilink")
as well as keeping [The Order](The_Order_Sect "wikilink") out of our city
makes the [Defenders](Guardian_Sect "wikilink") easily our staunchest allies."

**Healer** - "The Devouring Jungle is a wilderness full of all manner of
horrifying diseases and poisons, making the [Benevolent](Healer_Sect "wikilink")
a true boon in the city and on any expedition."

**Ice** - "Generally untrustworthy, but they seem genuine enough in their
alliance with the [Guardians](Guardian_Sect "wikilink"), so we will trust
them for now. At least a little."

**Knave** - "Thieving devils, but if they can be directed properly than
the skills of the [Pickpockets](Knaves_Guild "wikilink") can be rather useful."

**Life** - "The [Rangers](Life_Sect "wikilink") bring in an interesting array
of items, goods and discoveries from the Devouring Jungle, as well as keeping
tabs on the Bisch herds and monsters roaming in its depths. Highly useful
so keep them well supplied for the journey."

**Psychic** - "We have no secrets to keep, so nothing to fear from the
[Timus Marked](Psychic_Sect "wikilink"). Keep yourself honest and you will
also need have no concerns."

**Research** - "We don't have much use for their various absurd
inventions, but they are helpful at least in keeping the Jump Gates
operational."

**The Order** - "The [Stripebacks](The_Order_Sect "wikilink") remain
adamant that only they can provide for security and crime fighting. We
remain equally certain that we are doing perfectly fine without them
slicing off hands and tongues, thank you very much."

**Universe** - "The presence of one of their observatories in Karamaterra
doesn't mean that we should trust a Sect renowned for manipulating
luck to their own ends. Be cautious."

**Warrior** - "A staunch front line against the monsters and 
creatures that threaten us all on a daily basis, as well as 
reliable, honourable allies."

**Water** - "Flexible and useful enough, in their own way, but
don't underestimate the effects their waterlogging can have
on our ability to manipulate the ground beneath our feet.
Nothing worse than expecting a full quake and only gettings a
minor tremor."

## **Sect Physrep**

**Colour**; **Primary Physrep.** - Brown, as stone or the earth underfoot.

**Symbol** - The White Mountain

**Tattoo** - The symbol of the Earth Sect is placed upon the *Sternum*.

**Clothing** - The city of Karamaterra, in the Eastern Land, is
the headquarters of the Earth Sect and where every member of the
Sect spends at least some of their time, even if assigned elsewhere.
The [City of Tamples](Karamaterra "wikilink") is truely beautiful
but is bakingly hot. As such many of the Sect favour light linens 
in their traditional colours, especially when having to also wear
armour, usually artfully cut or shaped to display the Sect
tattoo on the sternum. Some in colder climates favour having the image
embroidered onto the location instead.

**Weapon Preferences** - Being formed from the magics used traditionally
by the [Angelic](Angel "wikilink") inhabitants of Tal'Vorn, the members
of the Air Sect are traditionally trained and drilled in the usage of
the long spear favoured by the Children of
[Aeros](Aeros_the_Valorous "wikilink"). It can be used both in practical
defence and also as a literal lightning rod, useful for drawing down the
few close range spells this Sect has access to.

**Roleplaying Effects** - Air Sect casters, especially Angels, are
taught that they are magically and morally superior to most of the other
Sects and are known to act it. They dislike getting involved in close
combat, preferring to hang back from the lines and make use of the full
range of their powerful spells. They get on well with members of the
Order, Fire and Universe spells, with distinct rivalries with the Ice,
Guardian, Warrior and especially Earth Sect. They enjoy displaying their
power and superiority and often dress to impress, using the bright
yellow of lightning throughout their clothing and accessories.

## **Titles**

Earth Sect titles usually make reference to their dominion over the 
very ground underfoot, with references to stone, mountains, gems,
fortifcations and the earth itself being common.

        Example Titles; EarthSaviour, GemSeeker, MountainCrumbler, StoneBreaker, WallRaiser

## **Nicknames**

  - Grounded
  - Shattersteps
  - Diggers (insult)
  - Mudgrubbers (insult)
  - Terra' Marked
  - Shakers (Vorn City Slang)

## **Patron Deity**

The Patron Deity of the Shattersteps is, naturally, the God
of the Earth Himself, [Terra the Smith](Terra_The_Smith "wikilink").
Most of the Sect focus less upon His domain over smithing and 
crafting and more on the personification of stone and the mountains.
The Sect makes offerings of interesting stones or gems, often
giving prayer and thanks to the [Old Stone Bones](Terra_The_Smith "wikilink")
in groups as would be normal in the huge number of tamples in
their home city. Blessings asked for often cover more powerful
magics, strength granted to defensive forifications, especially
those made of rock or stone, or when embarking onto a new journey
into mountainous terrain.
  
As many of the Sect hail from the [City of Temples](Karamaterra "wikilink"),
they are also often non-specific in their worship, favouring
whichever deity is relevant to the task at hand. They still tend to
favour praying with others however, if such a thing is possible
at the time.
