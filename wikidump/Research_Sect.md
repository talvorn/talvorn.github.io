The Research Sect, generally speaking, has its history in experiments
performed by the Conflaris and Ether Walkers, but in all truth it took
the unashamed willingness to ask apparently stupid questions possessed
by Humanity in order to truly progress. Now they are a powerhouse of 
innovation, combining magic, technology and a shotgun approach to science
to craft all manner of strange, bizarre and, in somecases, completely
unhinged devices. The best example of this would be the booming field
of bionics; replacement limbs are within the ability of the Research
Sect to create, install and have function. However, the Sect likes such
things to be an upgrade, not simply a replacement, so many have weapons
or devices built in, including guns equipped with explosive rounds. In
your new leg.

The powers of the Sect are rooted in magnetism and, more recently, in
short-lived nanites. They also have a limited ability to modify perception,
by blinding scrying effects, technological devices and even actual sight.
This all manifests in repairing or breaking tools and devices, spontaneously
creating items from apparently irrelevant items, reducing objects and
creatures down to their base components via blasts of nanites or explosive
devices. They can armour themselves to a limited extent, as well as mimic
some lower level magic from a few of the other more esotric Sects using
their nanites, including Universe, Order, Life and even the dreaded Dark
Sect, but these spells will never be as powerful as a true Caster of the
given Sect.

Many of the Air Sect are also assigned to military vessels in both the
ocean going and airship fleets, ensuring good weather and fair winds in
the name of safety. Though doing this when commanded by their Sects is
one thing, some Air Casters make a good living doing the same job for
merchant vessels. Such mercenary activities are considered thoroughly
beneath the majority of the Sect however. Though it is officially
frowned upon, the Air Sect have been known to accept contracts for
nothing more or less than actual assassinations, especially by Casters
of the lower Ranks. Though Casters are well paid compared to Mundanes,
assassination generally pays a ridiculous sum of money, especially when
its required to be as obvious as an Air Sect strike. Little is as
effective at making a statement as a political opponent being struck
down by a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.

## **Representative Within Haven**

Alexander SteelWalker, Sorcerer Second Class

## **Opinion of Other Sects**


**Air** - "Interesting control over electrical forces which does not stray over into magnetism, but does also incluse isolation of areas of low and high air pressure in order to induce wind movement."  
  
**Dark** - "Seems to be able to accelerate some forms of decay in order to rot and destroy, as well as cause severe inflammation of the nervous system causing an excess of pain. All together it does not donate very much to a learning environment."

**Earth** - "The creation of localised tectonic forces is fascintating, if widely already studied. The psychology of of as to why they are so determined to keep the Order out of Karamaterra, on the other hand, is woefully under explained."

**Fire** - "Rapid increase in local temperatures causing a variety of combustion effects, all of them concluding in the same general result."

**Guardian** - "The ability of the Teachers to learn ow-level magics from other Sects is a high fascinating skill and one that begs to be examined at the most precise level."

**Healer** - ""

**Ice** - "Effectively the opposite effect of them Smokebelchers. Rapid decrease in ambient temperatures resulting in tissue damage and creation of hardened ice effects."

**Knave** - "Boring."

**Life** - "The limitations of regenerative ability and those of heightened senses are always fascinating subjects. Of course so is the ability to control localised plant-life with apparent skill and refinement!"

**Psychic** - "Sharing of data would be vastly more effecient and yet the Mindbuzzers insist upon hoarding it instead. Shows a paranoid, short-sighted mindset in our opinion."

**The Order** - "Pain is well understood but the inflammation of the nerves seems worryingly similar to Dark Sect magics and the domination abllity is certainly a security concern. Need to develop methods of detecting it to prevent our laboratories from being infiltrated."

**Universe** - "The ability to forsee multiple futures and isolate one for themselves or the victims of their luck bending magics without altering the flow of the future for anyone else? Monstrously powerful!"

**Warrior** - "Our opinion of the Warrior Sect is the only point at which we agree with our colleagues in the Noble. Useless."

**Water** - "Localised tidal waves, blasts of water, creation of quagmire or swamp, low level physical restoration, shields of liquid to protect from attacks . . . The list goes on and yet people accuse the Surfers of being underpowered?"

## **Sect Physrep**

**Colour**; **Primary Physrep.** - Dark grey.

**Symbol** - The Open Book

**Tattoo** - The symbol of the Researc Sect is placed upon the *Stomach*

**Clothing** - Utility and cleanliness are the primary concerns of the Scientists. Their clothing often incorporates a variety of pockets, belts and pouches for easy storage of devices and components, as well as being formed of reasonably resistant material in case of splashes or spills. Their robes, for a similar reason, are usually easy to don or remove, avoiding any complicated bucklets or buttons as when your clothing is on fire or melting, removing the item is more important than looking good whilst doing so.

**Weapon Preferences** - Generally speaking the Research Sect do not favour weapons, though some carry staves for self-defence or for poking potentially dangerous items at a distance. If they are forced to travel into dangerous locations however, then they do have on advantage over their fellow Sect members; gunpowder. The Research Sect are the foremeost creators of a variety of esoteric and strange gunpowder and Mani firearms and make use of these in dire need to unleash utter chaos on the battlefield.

**Roleplaying Effects** - The first thing that defines the Research Sect
is curiosity; their desire for knowledge is insatiable, and they are
continually asking questions and performing research. They have a tendency
towards doing things in order to see what the outcome is, even if the
outcome may not be positive, which can result in their detractors
thinking of the Sect as nigh-uncontrolled maniacs with a love of explosions.
To a limited extent, this is true; the Lord Research is generally happy
to allow his Casters to persue any line of enquiry they with, which can,
on occasion, end extremely badly.
  
## **Titles**

Research Sect titles generally make reference to either the mundane or
esoteric aspects of their work. Crafting, magnetism, knowledge and, quite
often, guns.

  - Example Titles; AbleBuilder, DeftSpark, GunCrafter, ResarchFinder, TestBreaker 

## **Nicknames**

  - Scientists
  - Experimenters
  - The Grey
  - Madmen (insult)
  - Wafflers (insult)
  - Lilar Marked
  - Tinkerer (Vorn City Slang)

## **Patron Deity**

Although a rational mind might be disinclined towards worship of the
Gods, this changes when said deities might turn up at your workstation
to take a personal interest in your latest project. The Research Sect 
politely pay homage to both Lilar and Terra as the Goddess of Technology
and God of Smithing respectively, depending upon the individuals preferred
area of research. Those focusing heavily on the biosciences might request 
the attention of Vriclar or those with no real idea of how to progress may
request the help of Grathis.
