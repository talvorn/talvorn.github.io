        Below is a list of every title currently *unavailable* to select
        as a new character along with the Sect they are associated with.
        This is because every single title is unique and thus once
        selected is unavailable. However, please also use this list as a
        source of inspiration for your own character\! Please take note
        of the format used for titles as well.
