Your Class chosen, you have made the decision as to where you belong in
the chaos of combat.

Now that we know what Class you wish to belong to, you can make the
choice as to which Sect to join. Pick wisely\! They are different in
more than their abilities. Each is a military organisation with needs
and desires that you should carefully consider should you wish to be
promoted and attain greater power.

## **Step Three; Sect**

**Healer**

  -

      -
        Pain is an anthama to the Healer Sect, but if need be they will
        bring it down upon their enemies. Unique amongst all the Sects
        in that none of their selection of spells is capable of dealing
        direct damage, the Healers can bring pain, poison and disease
        instead, though they are loath to do so. Instead the Sect
        prefers to strengthen their allies and bring soothing relief,
        restoration of damage and purge life and limb of the horrors
        that combat can inflict upon them. - [My careful skills and
        commanding presence will be a comfort to my
        allies.](GoldAngelHealer "wikilink")

**Life**

  -

      -
        Highly skilled and trained with forest and other rural terrain,
        the Life Sect specialises in strengthening their allies,
        recovering their health over time or bringing the varied wrath
        of nature down upon their foes. The natural world despises
        Demons, the Woken Dead and other such abominations and the Life
        Sect is unrivalled in their destruction. A skilled Life Caster
        is constantly prepared, calling upon the roots and might of
        nature to hold their foe in place whilst striking with longspear
        or bow from beyond reach and fading back into the forest. - [The
        wrath of nature will fall upon my foes like lightning from a
        clear sky.](GoldAngelLife "wikilink")

**Water**

  -

      -
        More eager to enter the closeness of melee than the other Sects
        of the Restorist Class, Casters of Water Magic can rely upon the
        ebb and flow of their namesake to protect them from the blows of
        their enemies. Should the wrath of a Water Caster grow high,
        then they can unleash torrents of water to knock foes aside,
        turn the ground to a quagmire in a heartbeat or even turn the
        air in a warriors lungs to water, drowning them in their own
        armour. Skilled in the use of both poleweapons and heavier
        armour, the Water Sect make for talented secondary melee
        fighters, able to hold and disrupt lines in equal measure. - [As
        unstoppable as the tides and as nurturing as the rain shall I
        be.](GoldAngelWater "wikilink")
