The Gods are real. This is not a subject open to debate as members of
the Divine Pantheon of either Shaltar or Timus have, on more than one
occasion, appeared in the streets of major cities. They are unlikely to
appear in person in the minor locale of Haven, but their might will be
felt strongly.

You are not forced to worship a deity, though the Divine looks dimly
upon those who deny their manifest might too openly. Select wisely, as
your chosen God or Goddess may well have expectations of you behind
simple lip service.
