The Air Sect was formed long before the arrival of humanity upon
Tal'Vorn. Rumoured to have been gifted to the [Angels](Angel "wikilink")
by Aeros the Sky Lord Himself, the magic focuses primarily upon
pin-point strikes of devastating power at long range against single
targets. As the Gods of Tal'Vorn were once exceedingly active, and even
today have been known to make personal appearances, the concept that Air
Magic could have been personally gifted to the
[Legions](Angel "wikilink") is not actually that far fetched. The God of
Valour has not been personally active upon the world in several
centuries however and so His creations have evolved and modified the
magic to their own purposes in the years since.

The Sect is naturally capable of calling down devastating hurricanes,
lightning storms and blasts of wind, but such things are considered
pointless displays of might that are beneath the majesty of the Air
Sect. A single strike of overwhelming force and precision is considered
the most acceptable usage of the Storm. An Air Caster can call upon
active weather fronts or simply create their own lightning from scratch,
though the former is considerably more powerful. Because of this the Air
Sect has developed several spells designed to create storm-clouds in
order to increase the damage of their spells in otherwise calm
conditions, though doing so is considered a sign of weakness and
desperation.

Many of the Air Sect are also assigned to military vessels in both the
ocean going and airship fleets, ensuring good weather and fair winds in
the name of safety. Though doing this when commanded by their Sects is
one thing, some Air Casters make a good living doing the same job for
merchant vessels. Such mercenary activities are considered thoroughly
beneath the majority of the Sect however. Though it is officially
frowned upon, the Air Sect have been known to accept contracts for
nothing more or less than actual assassinations, especially by Casters
of the lower Ranks. Though Casters are well paid compared to Mundanes,
assassination generally pays a ridiculous sum of money, especially when
its required to be as obvious as an Air Sect strike. Little is as
effective at making a statement as a political opponent being struck
down by a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.

## **Opinion of Other Sects**

**Air** - "Bright, confident lights, their minds glow with the power
of their self-assurance. Makes them easy to find and easier to read."

**Dark** - "Any of the Sects could become one of the [Damned](Dark_Sect "wikilink"),
so predictions on what their minds look or feel like are hard to make. 
More unfortunately they do tend to be quite good at hiding their
thoughts by necessity which makes finding them even harder."

**Earth** - "Utterly blunt and without compromise, as befits a Sect
so hell-bent on forging their own destingy. There are ways into
any fortification however, and [Guardians](Guardian_Sect "wikilink")
the [Shattersteps](Earth_Sect "wikilink") are not."

**Fire** - "If any Sect could be said to wear their hearts on their
sleeves, it would be the [Pyros](Fire_Sect "wikilink"). Almost makes
it pointless reading their minds."

**Guardian** - "Their minds are surprisingly difficult to read for a
Sect with magic that seems so straightforward. Perhaps an indication
of why they can cast cantrips from some of the other Sects?"

**Healer** - "Some of the [Kindly](Healer_Sect "wikilink") have 
minds like cotton wool, whilst others have a raxor blade lurking
in the fluff. Be careful which it is before you dig too deep."

**Ice** - "Most of their minds are as slick as the material their Sect
is named for, but there are a few inherent truths; most of the
[Glacial](Ice_Sect "wikilink") will do what is best for themselves at
any given point, and they expect others to do the same."

**Knave** - "An entire group trained in deception, lies and theft and
the Lord Magus decided that the best possible response was to
hire all of them? An experiment which we anticipate will end poorly."

**Life** - "There is an offly snimalistic tinge to the minds of the
[Rangers](Life_Sect "wikilink"), which should probably not be a
surprise really given their chosen vocation. This can make it
difficult to pluck anything beyond surface thoughts however."

**Research** - "Blindly providing any who requests it any 
information they desire will simply lead to chaos, death
and destruction. Of course we cannot condone such a thing and
thus we keep what secrets we can."

**The Order** - "Our work as interrogators with the 
[Just](The_Order_Sect "wikilink") is a necessary evil but not
one which we particularly enjoy. Still, they appreciate our
help and friendship is always appreciated."

**Universe** - "The multitude of futures which the 
[Fortunetellers](Universe_Sect "wikilink") constantly look out
upon wreck havoc upon our ability to read them. An actual 
walking Sect full of potentiality induced headaches."

**Warrior** - "Very little of interest in the sharp, 
blood-tinged thoughts of the Mundanes."

**Water** - "Some of the things the [Divers](Water_Sect "wikilink")
have seen in the deep places of the world would be better
off never being plucked from their minds."

## **Sect Physrep**

**Colour**; **Primary Physrep.** - Pale purple

**Symbol** - The Lidless Eye

**Tattoo** - The symbol of the Psychic Sect is placed upon the *Tongue*. As we appeciate the difficulty of physrepping this, then the chin or forehead are fine as well.

**Clothing** - Like most Arcanists, the Air Sect prefer to keep their
hands free in order to manage the more complex gestures required of
their aggressive spells and also to ensure that their closer range
attacks are not accidentally earthed into their own clothing. There is a
distinct similarity to more traditional Angelic clothing as well,
causing togas and stola to be common amongst members of the Sect,
regardless of their racial origin.

**Weapon Preferences** - Being formed from the magics used traditionally
by the [Angelic](Angel "wikilink") inhabitants of Tal'Vorn, the members
of the Air Sect are traditionally trained and drilled in the usage of
the long spear favoured by the Children of
[Aeros](Aeros_the_Valorous "wikilink"). It can be used both in practical
defence and also as a literal lightning rod, useful for drawing down the
few close range spells this Sect has access to.

**Roleplaying Effects** - Air Sect casters, especially Angels, are
taught that they are magically and morally superior to most of the other
Sects and are known to act it. They dislike getting involved in close
combat, preferring to hang back from the lines and make use of the full
range of their powerful spells. They get on well with members of the
Order, Fire and Universe spells, with distinct rivalries with the Ice,
Guardian, Warrior and especially Earth Sect. They enjoy displaying their
power and superiority and often dress to impress, using the bright
yellow of lightning throughout their clothing and accessories.

## **Titles**

Air Sect titles most often make reference to the more aggressive aspects
of their magic, focusing upon storms, lightning, thunder and so forth,
though some prefer less ominous methods of referring to themselves.

## **Patron Deity**

Being primarily composed of Angels and using a magic created by that
self-same Race, the Air Sect has a definite leaning towards the worship
of Aeros, the Sky Lord. The Stormcallers focus less upon Aeros' aspect
as the God of Valour and more upon His dominion over Flight and Air
itself, invoking His name when attempting complex rituals, embarking
upon dangerous sea voyages, before a potentially lethal mission or
simply as part of daily life.
