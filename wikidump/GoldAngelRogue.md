Your Class chosen, you have made the decision as to where you belong in
the chaos of combat.

Now that we know what Class you wish to belong to, you can make the
choice as to which Sect to join. Pick wisely\! They are different in
more than their abilities. Each is a military organisation with needs
and desires that you should carefully consider should you wish to be
promoted and attain greater power.

## **Step Three; Sect**

**Knave**

  -

      -
        Agility, speed, cunning and explosive violence, the life of a
        Knave is an unusual one compared to the Sects of the Magus
        Council. Less a military organisation and more of a loose
        collection of individuals with similar skill sets and useful
        abilities that the Council has suffered to be allowed to
        continue to exist, the Knaves Guild are by definition mercenary
        in outlook. Preferring archery or twin blades, a Knave is the
        epitome of roguish evasion and sudden damage, striking from
        cover and fading away unseen. - [A single arrow in the right
        place can do more than an entire legion of
        Warriors.](GoldAngelKnave "wikilink")

**Research**

  -

      -
        Possessing undisputed dominance of technology, the Research Sect
        can render the ranged weapons of their enemies useless even
        whilst improving those of their allies, shatter magical
        defences, create magical and mundane equipment as well as
        unleash the power of magnetism to make the life of a heavily
        armoured opponent into something utterly hellish. Ultimately
        however it is in the broad range of crafting and creation of
        technological devices that the Research Sect's strength lies,
        though one should not underestimate the effects of a bullet to
        the face from one of their modified pistols. . - [Technology is
        a useful tool of the nobility, one that I will put to sound
        use.](GoldAngelResearch "wikilink")

**Universe**

  -

      -
        To the other Sects, the Casters of Universe magics are sometimes
        dismissed as daydreamers and stargazers, astronomers and fortune
        tellers of little worth in combat. Only someone who has not seen
        them in action could hold that opinion however. Masters of luck,
        gravity and able to glimpse fragments of possible futures, a
        Universe Caster can be a nightmare to face. Secrets are almost
        impossible to keep from them, ambushes fall upon barren ground
        and the very laws of reality bend and fold underfoot, making
        bringing them to honest combat difficult, if not impossible. -
        [The stars will be my guide and bring me good
        fortune.](GoldAngelUniverse "wikilink")
