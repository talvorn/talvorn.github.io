Your Class chosen, you have made the decision as to where you belong in
the chaos of combat.

Now that we know what Class you wish to belong to, you can make the
choice as to which Sect to join. Pick wisely\! They are different in
more than their abilities. Each is a military organisation with needs
and desires that you should carefully consider should you wish to be
promoted and attain greater power.

## **Step Three; Sect**

**Earth**

  -

      -
        The Earth Sect brings indiscriminate ruin to *all* who dare to
        step within range of their spells. Their spells shake the ground
        with every step, summon spires of stone to strike their foes,
        encase their own flesh in protective layers of rock, draw upon
        the strength of the earth itself and reinforce the metal of
        their weapons. - [I will step down upon the unclean earth from
        the endless sky to lay waste to my
        foes.](GoldAngelEarth "wikilink")

**Guardian**

  -

      -
        Broadly speaking, a well trained and prepared Guardian edges
        towards the unkillable. First and foremost this Sect are
        defensive spell casters and teachers of younger students. They
        patrol the streets in support of the Order Sect, though there is
        a long standing rivalry between the two, and are capable melee
        combatants. Their spells vary somewhat but follow a typical
        theme; a Guardian can shrug off the spells of their enemies,
        destroy weapons and armour with a touch, encase themselves in
        powerful armour and can learn a limited range of spells
        belonging to other Sects. - [The shimmering green energy of my
        spells will turn aside all
        attacks.](GoldAngelGuardian "wikilink")

**The Order**

  -

      -
        The Order are trained to be both police and jury on the streets
        of the cities they serve. With spells capable of causing great
        pain, stripping a foe of their magical defences, sapping their
        will to fight and keep their allies in the riot line intact, the
        Order Caster is flexible and dangerous. They possess little in
        the way of direct damage but their spells can cause confusion
        and chaos like little else. - [My word will be as
        law.](GoldAngelOrder "wikilink")

**Warrior**

  -

      -
        The dominating force in a close, lethal melee, a Warrior is
        incapable of casting magic like the other Sects but makes up for
        it with brutally impressive physical abilities. Able to stay
        alive through sheer force of will, deal massive damage with
        their blows, inspire their allies and rattle the senses of their
        enemies, the professional soldiers of the Warrior Sect are a
        force to be reckoned with. - [The gleam of steel is all I need
        to bring low my foe.](GoldAngelWarrior "wikilink")
