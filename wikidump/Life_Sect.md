The Air Sect was formed long before the arrival of humanity upon
Tal'Vorn. Rumoured to have been gifted to the [Angels](Angel "wikilink")
by Aeros the Sky Lord Himself, the magic focuses primarily upon
pin-point strikes of devastating power at long range against single
targets. As the Gods of Tal'Vorn were once exceedingly active, and even
today have been known to make personal appearances, the concept that Air
Magic could have been personally gifted to the
[Legions](Angel "wikilink") is not actually that far fetched. The God of
Valour has not been personally active upon the world in several
centuries however and so His creations have evolved and modified the
magic to their own purposes in the years since.

The Sect is naturally capable of calling down devastating hurricanes,
lightning storms and blasts of wind, but such things are considered
pointless displays of might that are beneath the majesty of the Air
Sect. A single strike of overwhelming force and precision is considered
the most acceptable usage of the Storm. An Air Caster can call upon
active weather fronts or simply create their own lightning from scratch,
though the former is considerably more powerful. Because of this the Air
Sect has developed several spells designed to create storm-clouds in
order to increase the damage of their spells in otherwise calm
conditions, though doing so is considered a sign of weakness and
desperation.

Many of the Air Sect are also assigned to military vessels in both the
ocean going and airship fleets, ensuring good weather and fair winds in
the name of safety. Though doing this when commanded by their Sects is
one thing, some Air Casters make a good living doing the same job for
merchant vessels. Such mercenary activities are considered thoroughly
beneath the majority of the Sect however. Though it is officially
frowned upon, the Air Sect have been known to accept contracts for
nothing more or less than actual assassinations, especially by Casters
of the lower Ranks. Though Casters are well paid compared to Mundanes,
assassination generally pays a ridiculous sum of money, especially when
its required to be as obvious as an Air Sect strike. Little is as
effective at making a statement as a political opponent being struck
down by a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.

## **Opinion of Other Sects**

**Air** - "They have so many options for freedom and yet most of them
simply spend their days preening and revelling in their own superiority.
The ones who work at sea through are usually good people, used to
hardship and more humble because of it."

**Dark** - "A collective abomination against the natural world,
embodying decay far beyond the normal cycle. They are a force of
entropy without renewal and this is unacceptable."

**Earth** - "Some of the areas of our magic overlap and we are fine
with this as the [Shattersteps](Earth_Sect "wikilink") are generally
willing to live in relative harmony with the world around them,
especially in their city of [Karamaterra](Karamaterra "wikilink"). The
Devouring Jungle around there is wonderfully lush with life and a fine
place to spend time and energy."

**Fire** - "Fire has its place in nature, as it can provide space
for regrowth and renewal of life but be wary in case the
[Smokebelchers](Fire_Sect "wikilink") take it to the extreme."

**Guardian** - "Their focus on life within the cities is much like
[The Order](The_Order_Sect "wikilink") despite the pairs mutual objections
and thus does not bring us into contact very often. They seem to be as
rigid in their thinking as their armour is. Perhaps not a bad thing,
but it also makes them potentially brittle."

**Healer** - "Whilst we focus on the realm of accelerating a bodies
abilities and own restorative healing and the [Kindly](Healer_Sect "wikilink")
primarily force restoration through more powerful magics, we still have a lot in
common and work well together."

**Ice** - "That which we do in the forests and jungles, the 
[Glacial](Ice_Sect "wikilink") do in the mountains and tundra. For
all their vaunted political unreliability, in this task at least
they can be trusts to be efficient and effective."

**Knave** - "It's very rare that we have anything to do with the
[Pickpockets](Knaves_Guild "wikilink"), if only because it is rare
that we spend a lot of time in the city. From what we have seen they
are good at what they do, but since that sometimes includes theft,
we are not sure we entirely approve."

**Psychic** - "We have no secrets that would interest the
[Readers](Psychic_Sect "wikilink") and thus we have no issue
with their telepathic abilities."

**Research** - "Yet another Sect who has little interest in
stepping beyond the confines of the urban environment. Short-sighted
of the [Scientists](Research_Sect "wikilink") really when you bear
in mind the botanical wonders that are waiting out there."

**The Order** - "Even we cannot escape the iron grasp of the
[Stripebacks](The_Order_Sect "wikilink"), but law and order
is better in the cities than survival of the fittest at least. 
Just mind your manners and all should be well."

**Universe** - "Raw luck is a difficult thing to quantify, but
that does not stop the [Stargazers](Universe_Sect "wikilink") 
from somehow managing it. Be careful if you seek to track them as
the clearest trail may turn into a trap at any moment."

**Warrior** - "As we explore the wilds of Tal'Vorn, so do the
[Ironclad](Warrior_Sect "wikilink") guard against it. They are
supremely helpful should be we come across some monster or
[Bisch](Bisch "wikilink") incursion that we cannot resolve alone,
so keep the local Warriors sweet."

**Water** - "There are places in the world that even we cannot
go, and the oceans and deep lakes are one of them. In this regard
 we work closely and well with the Divers."

## **Sect Physrep**

**Colour**; **Primary Physrep.** - Pale green, sometimes with brown accents

**Symbol** - The Fallen Leaf

**Tattoo** - The symbol of the Air Sect is placed upon the *Left
Shoulder Blade*

**Clothing** - Like most Arcanists, the Air Sect prefer to keep their
hands free in order to manage the more complex gestures required of
their aggressive spells and also to ensure that their closer range
attacks are not accidentally earthed into their own clothing. There is a
distinct similarity to more traditional Angelic clothing as well,
causing togas and stola to be common amongst members of the Sect,
regardless of their racial origin.

**Weapon Preferences** - Being formed from the magics used traditionally
by the [Angelic](Angel "wikilink") inhabitants of Tal'Vorn, the members
of the Air Sect are traditionally trained and drilled in the usage of
the long spear favoured by the Children of
[Aeros](Aeros_the_Valorous "wikilink"). It can be used both in practical
defence and also as a literal lightning rod, useful for drawing down the
few close range spells this Sect has access to.

**Roleplaying Effects** - Air Sect casters, especially Angels, are
taught that they are magically and morally superior to most of the other
Sects and are known to act it. They dislike getting involved in close
combat, preferring to hang back from the lines and make use of the full
range of their powerful spells. They get on well with members of the
Order, Fire and Universe spells, with distinct rivalries with the Ice,
Guardian, Warrior and especially Earth Sect. They enjoy displaying their
power and superiority and often dress to impress, using the bright
yellow of lightning throughout their clothing and accessories.

## **Titles**

Air Sect titles most often make reference to the more aggressive aspects
of their magic, focusing upon storms, lightning, thunder and so forth,
though some prefer less ominous methods of referring to themselves.

  - Vagrents (insult)
  - Feral (insult)
  - Vriclar' Marked
  - Wilder (Vorn City Slang)

## **Patron Deity**

Being primarily composed of Angels and using a magic created by that
self-same Race, the Air Sect has a definite leaning towards the worship
of Aeros, the Sky Lord. The Stormcallers focus less upon Aeros' aspect
as the God of Valour and more upon His dominion over Flight and Air
itself, invoking His name when attempting complex rituals, embarking
upon dangerous sea voyages, before a potentially lethal mission or
simply as part of daily life.
