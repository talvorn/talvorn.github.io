Congratulations, you've taken the first step in creating your
character\!

The next step is help find the correct Sect for you. The Sects are
broadly divided into OC 'Classes'. A 'Class' covers your basic job in a
fight or an encounter.

## **Step Two; Class**

**Fighter** - *Heavy Armour Use and +5 Mani/Power*

  -

      -
        Experts in close, melee combat, the members of the Fighter Class
        have very high hit points and high armour, though their magic
        returns very slowly. One member of this Class, the Warrior, has
        no magical capabilities at all, benefiting from extreme physical
        training instead. - [Yes, bring on the close
        melee\!](GoldAngelFighter "wikilink")

**Restorist** - *Medium Armour Use and +10 Mani*

  -

      -
        Trained in defensive combat, including wearing moderately heavy
        armour and shield use. They possess spells that can buff, heal
        and protect their allies as well as benefiting from relatively
        high hit points and a lot of skills allowing them to negate or
        avoid damage. - [I will be a boon to my
        allies.](GoldAngelRestorist "wikilink")

**Rogue** - *Light Armour Use and +15 Mani/Power*

  -

      -
        Rogues are trained in agile combat, high damage and cunning.
        However they tend towards the low end of hit points and armour,
        though their spells can be very flexible. Most of their buffs
        benefit only themselves however. - [They will never see me
        coming.](GoldAngelRogue "wikilink")

**Arcanist** - *+20 Mani*

  -

      -
        Powerful, aggressive casters, with rapid recovery of magical
        abilities and devastating spells. They suffer from low hit
        points and very low armour, though in some cases this armour can
        be reinforced through magic. - [All shall fall before my arcane
        might\!](GoldAngelArcanist "wikilink")
