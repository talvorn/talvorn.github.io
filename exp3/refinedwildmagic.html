Refined Wild Magic is an exceptionally violent and powerful magic, taken from old DragonLord magics. It has been honed and made far more delicate and adaptable than the Wild Magic of the East. It is capable of defensive spells, highly aggressive attacks, delicate targeting and vast destruction. It has weak points of course, being unable to affect reality, heal, create life, influence the minds of others and so on, but as a general purpose magic it is extremely potent.<br>
<br>
Developed by Sintai AcidSpitter to give himself a greater edge over any duals with other FirstBorn DragonLords, the Green DragonLord fully intends to use it to crush Drake FrostHeart once and for all. Drake is notoriously bad at most forms of magic, including Wild Magic, preferring to use his own innate abilities and incredible strength to his advantage instead.<br>


<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Refined Wild Magic is a method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has its own Forbidden Magic. Though not controlled by the Magus Council, these spells are equivalent in power and require immense will and courage to cast.</blockquote>

<ul><li> <b>Annihilate </b><br>
<i>A single gesture and a hissed word is enough, should the Caster be strong enough, to produce a blast of energy powerful enough to completely vaporise a single target in a heartbeat. This was developed by Sintai specifically to kill Drake.</i><br><br></li><li> 

<b>Shaltar’s Light </b><br>
<i>The most powerful form of Refined Wild magic in its aspect as a defensive art, Shaltar’s Light erects multiple layers of bright energy around the Caster that flay away under attack, protecting the user from nearly any assault.	</i></li></ul>

<br>

Refined Wild Magic is the sole province of the Ancient DragonLords and they do not hesitate to utilise it in the prosecuting of their wars. Combined with strength at arms, indomitable courage and phenomenal resilience it makes the armed forces of the Scions of Sintai nearly impossible to resist. Though not without its flaws, Refined Wild Magic is specifically designed and altered to be the absolute height of a DragonLords natural magical capability, without resort to the weakling Sect Magics of the East.<br>

<br>
The Symbol of Refined Wild Magic is a Beam of Energy.<br>
<br>
The undisputed master of Refined Wild Magic is without question Sintai AcidSpitter as it was he that developed the Magic from the Wild Magic of the East. <br>
