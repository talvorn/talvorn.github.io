Feral Magic is the magic gifted in the blood of the Nemar people, though its tenants can still be passed on to others. It involves becoming one with nature itself, shifting and altering your body to reflect this oneness. A Feral Magic user can take on the forms of different animals and plants around them; change their skin to bark for defence or change their feet to roots for stability, grow powerful claws to attack or broad bat-like wings to fly. This gives a skilled user a remarkable array of flexibility and adaptability on the battlefield. Not everything about the magic revolves around the alteration of the Caster however.<br>
<br>
Some of the spells within this school of magic allow the caster to alter his allies or even to call upon the forces of nature themselves, causing roots to lash out at enemies or wolves to lope in to assist them. In this way Feral Magic can best be described as a balance between the Bisch’s Pack Magic and the spells of the Life Sect. It is related to, but completely different from both, having a somewhat different, more personal focus and requiring a true connection with the living things around the Caster.<br>


<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Feral Magic is a method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has its own Forbidden Magic. Though not controlled by the Magus Council, these spells are equivalent in power and require immense will and courage to cast.</blockquote>

<ul><li> <b>Chimera</b><br>
<i>Transforming into a bastardised form of at least half a dozen different animals at once, the Caster swells in size to triple the usual, gaining immense strength and endurance, as well as the heightened abilities of the various creatures selected for the spell. Though the spell itself is pretty simple, it is the combination of animals that can be used that makes it powerful.</i><br><br></li><li> 

<b>True Shifter</b><br>
<i>This spell simply allows the Caster to let go of his normal form, becoming a shapeless creature that can take on the full forms of animals at will and as quickly as blinking for the full duration of the spell. The array of animals is unlimited and nothing stops the Caster changing mid-attack or mid-dodge. This is a truly exhausting spell however.</i></li></ul>

<br>

Feral Magic is given a place of extreme importance is Nemar society, as most of the species is capable of casting it to some form or another. It is a part of their lives, with Nemar forming wings for swift travel or gills for breathing underwater. Indeed it is so common amidst their people that many believe it is an inherent ability to the species, hence their nickname of the Shifters. Nemar shamans teach younglings the simpler spells in order to give them something to defend themselves with; this practice being more wide-spread than weapon training, so efficient is the magic.<br>
