It is said, by those that like to think of themselves as
wise, that anything is possible should sufficient will be brought to
bear upon it. Indeed why should it not be possible in a world such as
Tal'Vorn, a world where suits of armour have life, fog drains the life
from other creatures and beasts walk like men? Physicality, reality and
time are all concepts of how we perceive the world around us. They are
mutable, alterable and diverse in many ways that mere humans
cannot even begin to fathom. They can be altered by a being with
sufficient power of mind and such a being was Timus, the God of Time.<br>
<br>
Timus is beyond powerful, beyond understanding and beyond
comprehension. He is a God who cannot be understood, His speech making
references to events past, present and future, events that may or may
not have come to pass in this time stream or reality, events long
before the birth of stars and long after they have all died out. Indeed
it is rare for the God of Time to even notice the 'present'. Timus
walks between time so easily because He understands the true nature of
this most confusing and paradoxical of the mortal methods of measuring
our existence.<br>
<br>
Time is not real, not touchable, not reachable. It is just perception,
a way in which mortal beings measure out the length of their existence.
Yet it is required to exist, for with no sense of time then mortal
creatures would be unable to exist. Everything to a mortal revolves
around time, the length they have to live, the way in which they exist
and the manner in which they interact with other living creatures.
However it is this very perception of time that keeps us trapped within
the present.<br>
<br>
The concept of time as laid down by the Psychic Sect is difficult to
understand and not even remotely simplistic. It states that all time is
now, every moment is this moment and that past, present and future are
one thing. According to the theory every single moment is happening
right now. This is almost impossible to comprehend, to understand that
time is so strange that it could possibly exist in a single instant.
Timus understands this and uses it as His power, the ability to walk
between worlds and realities. He can walk this way because, at one
time, not only was everything at the same time but it was also all in
the same place. The creation of the universe, called by the human
scientists who descended upon their ships of flame, and rather crudely
called at that, the Big Bang.<br>
<br>
Timus Himself is constantly changing. In His normal state, if the word
normal can be used upon a God, He appears as a mortal, though the
specific Race constantly changes, who shifts rapidly from a baby to old
age, the actual sex flickering constantly from one to the other. His
features are almost impossible to make out, the skin shifting like
liquid all the time as Timus alters His body and features to fit His
minds desires. However one thing remains constant at all times. His
eyes, a blue as bright as the sky and as piercing as the sharpest
blade. It is said that Timus can see into the minds of others and,
though this is not true, His mastery of Time allows Him to simply know
what it coming next.<br>
<br>
Timus found the other Races upon Tal'Vorn boring, bound by their weak,
mortal bodies and limited magical abilities into a world that, though
immense was ultimately with strict boundaries. With this in mind, Timus
set out to create a species that could control the drifting currents of
the Ether, the shifting dimensional tides that ebbed and twisted around
'reality' like water around a stone. Timus created the Ether Walkers,
born from His own power and skill, gifted with the ability to walk
between dimensions and, when their power increased, through time
itself, a race so strange that they where beyond the understanding of
most of the other creatures that lived and breathed upon Tal'Vorn's
face.<br>

<br>
The Ether Walkers are tall, gangly creatures, well over nine foot high
making them the tallest of the Elder Races. Their flesh, a dull grey in
colour, is tougher then human skin, designed to act in the same way
that clothing acts for a human, to give the Ether Walker protection
against the elements. The skin of an Ether Walker does not scar, the
wound leaving no mark once it is fully healed, a feature designed to
protect the flesh from any weaknesses that could hurt the Ether Walker
more at a later date.<br>
<br>
Ether Walkers are, at first glance, apparently blind and dumb,
possessing neither eyes nor mouths to speak with. Yet this seems to
disable them little except in areas with many people or a large amount
of noise. Instead of sight, Ether Walkers see almost like bats do,
emitting a constant stream of low band psychic 'clicks' which bounce
off the surrounding environment and allow the Ether Walker to 'see' the
world around him as the waves come back to him. Of course this makes
seeing in colour or indeed any sort of shades at all, impossible,
throwing the world as seen by a Ether Walker into a kind of series of
grey photographs. Depth perception is easy, however, as it is simply
based upon the amount of time it takes for the said 'click' to bounce
back to the Ether Walker.<br>
<br>
Of course it is possible to interfere with the Ether Walkers 'sight'
and things moving at a high enough speed will have changed position
before the psychic 'click' returns to the Ether Walker. Generally
however it serves as well as eyesight does for humans, and in some
cases better, giving superior depth perception, is unaffected by
changes in the light and ranging abilities. It certainly allows the
Ether Walker to fight in combat if required, though they are not
physically built for such brutality, preferring ranged weapons or magic.<br>
<br>
As for hearing, Ether Walkers have this in abundance. An uncanny
ability to hear the sound of anotherï¿½s heartbeat, the rush of their
blood in their veins and the hiss of their breath in and out of their
lungs. This makes them exceptionally skilled at fighting in the dark
when combined with their psychic 'clicks', thus allowing them to move
through the other 'realms' of existence which are in general unlit by
the touch of a sun. Their hearing, though exceptional, can also be a
weak point as they can be confused in large crowds due to the large
amount of conflicting noises from multiple directions and single very
loud sounds can also damage their sensitive ear membranes.<br>
<br>
The Ether Walkers have an innate talent for magic, though it is not as
powerful as many people are given to believe. The Ether Walkers do not
make their way between the dimensions through the usage of magic, but
rather through a specific frequency of psychic cry that resonates with
the dimension that they wish to travel too, causing a 'pathway' to open
up, very similar to the way in which Jump Gates work. Indeed Jump Gates
actually open a hole into a dimension that the Ether Walkers call the
'Ether Sea'. It has never been clear why they call this place that, though
the absolute lack of solid surface or, indeed, anything else, might
account for it. By all records, the 'Sea' is both minute and, at the same
time, immense beyond imagining.<br>
<br>
Psychic talent though, unlike their magic, is a skill that the Ether
Walkers are unrivalled in. They can speak with their minds as clearly
as any other Race might make words, directing their thoughts straight
into the brain of the one they wish to speak with. This is a highly
useful ability, making an Ether Walker conversation incredibly
difficult to eavesdrop on. However many races, specifically the
DragonLords, Anvar, Beasts and Demons, take great exception to this
psychic intrusion, some DragonLords having been recorded as slipping
into a strange 'Berserker' state and then frenziedly attacking the Ether
Walker until either the DragonLord is knocked unconscious, the Ether
Walker has been killed or the Ether Walker has fled.<br>

<br>
The Ether Walkers typically live in loosely knit family groups, though
the entire family may never be gathered together in one place. Yet, as
each Ether Walker emits a unique low key psychic 'signature', should it
be required any of the Ether Walkers could find another provided they
knew the frequency of their 'signature'. Though this means that Ether
Walkers do not have the most normal family lives, it does mean that
they know full well that they are never alone, which is more then most
of the other creatures upon Tal'Vorn can profess to, even those with
larger families then is strictly the norm.<br>
<br>
Ether Walkers seem to reproduce in a manner similar to a Sea Horse, in
that they female produces a large number of eggs and the male then
carries them to term. However due to the dangers of the many
environments that the Ether Walkers live in it is unlikely that more
then a handful of these eggs will ever hatch, let alone grow into fully
fledged Ether Walkers. For this reason Ether Walkers are fiercely
protective of their young until the young Ether Walker reaches full
maturity after the first year of their life.<br>
<br>
Ether Walkers are renowned as great explorers and inventors, though it
may be that their 'inventions' are simply copies of devices that the
Ether Walkers discovered in alternate dimensions or different
timelines. Regardless of how they come across their technology however,
it is certain that the Ether Walkers are the most technologically
advanced of all the Races, even the metal loving Dwarves. They
frequently make use of hand-held gunpowder based weapons and a few have
even managed to alter the old human Personal Tactical Dreadnought Class
Body Armoured Unit (PTAU) to fit their gangly bodies. Fortunately these
cases are rare and generally the PTAU units tend to run out of power or
break down before the Order can capture the unit. Should the Order or
the Research Sect ever come across a working PTAU unit however then the
balance of power would be destroyed in a drastic shift towards the
respective Sect.<br>
<br>
One thing that the Ether Walkers have managed to create however that has
been accepted without question across the entire face of Tal'Vorn is
the Jump Gate. Based upon experimental theories derived from their own
resonance ability, the Ether Walkers extrapolated that a device built
using the correct materials and with sufficient precision could mimic, to
a lesser degree, the ability of the Ether Walkers to step between
dimensions and could thus be used for long distance high speed travel
across Tal'Vorn's face. Unable to construct such a device on their own,
the Ether Walkers came to the Dwarf city of Drazzahezz. As luck would
have it, they arrived just as the Dwarves were under siege. Showing
typical logical thought, the Ether Walkers joined in on the side of the
Dwarves, reasoning that to do so would place them in good stead with
the Dwarf Race.<br>
<br>
After the Anvar, the Race that was attacking the Dwarves had been
driven off, the Ether Walkers explained their idea to the Dwarves who
eagerly agreed and immediately set to work, their best Engineers working
closely with the Ether Walkers on the design and the construction of
the first two Jump Gates. However due to the stresses placed upon the
structure of the device, the Dwarves would be unable to make it with
stone or any of the limited metals available to them. Thus the Ether
Walkers simply 'Walked' to the Dragons Eye, the planetoid in orbit
around Tal'Vorn. Dragons Eye is a planetoid almost completely made out
of iron ore, allowing the Ether Walkers to gather by hand enough of the
ore to permit the creation of just enough steel for the construction of
the first two Gates.<br>
<br>
Once the Gates were finished, a group of the Ether Walkers took one of
the Gates up to Dragons Eye from where the Dwarves could travel through
the Gates and thus mine more of the precious iron ore. From there the
number of smaller Jump Gates have increased exponentially, the Ether
Walkers 'Walking' them to each of the major cities and along the routes
there as the smaller Gates have a limited range.<br>

<br>
What is not understood however is exactly WHY the Ether Walkers chose
to do this. And this is, perhaps, the fundamentally confusing point of
an Ether Walkers existence, that which places them beyond the
understanding of the other Races. Their motives are impossible to read
and their expressions don't even exist, their thoughts unpredictable and their
actions sometimes contradictory. Yet the Ether Walkers are still feared
and respected as a Race that has seen wonders that others will never
see, walked in places where no other living foot has fallen and heard
sounds that are truly out of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The approximate bipolar resonances inherent to the creation of such a
device are highly dangerous to attempt to control with such rudimentary
construction materials and thus this Endeavour would be highly illogical
were there any other reason behind such a complicated creation of our
co-joined Races, yet we, the Ether Walkers, have determined that this is
the best course of action for our Race.</i><br>
