<hr /><br><Br><Br></center>




The Shadow arrived in the South approximately three hundred years ago, immediately imposing its dominance over the Venris, kidnapping hundreds of children to raise them in the darkness of Darmah. These children would be forever changed, becoming the so called NightEaters, locked into service to the Shadow. This creature has never been truly described, people simply referring to it as a strange, darkness that moves with a will of its own.<br>
<br>
Sunlight cannot penetrate the Shadow and doesnâ€™t weaken or diminish it, like it does a Mist Devil. Nor does the creature seem to possess eyes; instead a mask made out of pure black light, expressionless and remorseless, looks down upon its victims. It is known to be able to physically affect the world around it, touching, destroying and building, but it can also make its touch incredibly inimical to humanoid life, burning and searing the flesh.<br>
<br>
The Shadow appears to be completely without normal morals, simply bending the Venris to its will seemingly just because it can. In the same way it forces slaves to dig for metals and gems to equip the Shadows armies to wage war that, again, the Shadow simply seems to want to wage for no particular reason. It can nothing tangible by taking Toth that it does not already possess and it seems the creature just loves to cause chaos and spread misery.<br>
