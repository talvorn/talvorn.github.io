The Morain are a new arrival in the South, having been brought into being by some unknown deity at some point in the last decade. They are a young, vibrant Race that have adapted well to the desert climate of Hasch, seemingly unfazed by the baking head of the island. Though no member of their Race is older than ten years of age, they seem to have a nobility and courage beyond their youth, aging quickly to adulthood. They say they are the Children of Sorand, but since this name is unknown it is viewed as a misinterpretation of one of the more common Gods, something the Morain are quick to deny.<br>
<br />
<br /> <strong>Physical Description:</strong> They are hulking, gargoyle-like creatures with powerful blunt claws on both hands and feet which can still be turned to delicate tasks, and yet are strong enough to crush stone. The skin of a Morain tends towards grey or other natural stone-like colours, with dark hair and eyes, though exceptions have been observed. Large, bat-like wings spread from their shoulder blades, even wider than those of Angels since these are forced to bear a much greater weight. They are incapable of true flight, but can instead glide from place to place, using their powerful claws to climb up rock faces and leap off into the thermals of Hasch. The most peculiar thing about these creatures is that they possess a very specific form of bio-morphing, being able to transform into stone, should they wish to. In this state they are completely helpless and unaware but heal their wounds exceptionally quickly. Females are very similar to the males, except tending to be thinner of build, possessing breasts and hips like most other humanoid Races, though most Morain have yet to work out what to with them.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Personality:</strong> The Morain are extremely courageous as a Race. Though they comprehend risk fully as any other intelligent creature does, these Children of Sorand are far more likely to take risks and stand up in the face of overwhelming odds. This they say is to honour their deity. Morain are also taciturn, stoic and almost humourless. This is perhaps not an aspect of their Race however, more to do with their youth as they have yet had time to discover true humour and find their footing on a psychological level. As a Race they are willing to take on great burdens in the name of honour and courage, without complaint or objection. The Morain are a stern but brave and noble people.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Religion:</strong> The Morain are extremely devoted to their deity, Sorand, claiming him to the God of Courage, Honour and Strength. Whether this is true or not is hotly debated, especially by the Ancient DragonLord and Conflais they interact with. Oddly however the Nemar seem to be strangely silent on the matter. Unlike the Anvar, the Morain do not seek converts, but will happily speak of Sorand should a listener be interested and this can sometimes go on until the initial interest has long since faded. Carving simple shrines into the faces of rocky spires on Hasch, the Morain seem to depict Sorand as a larger, armoured version of themselves, though the warrior bears no weapon into combat, seemingly relying upon his massive claws instead. 

<br /> <br /> <strong>Relations:</strong> The Morain have got on well with most Races they have encountered so far, their honourable nature making them worthy of interest in the eyes of the Children of Shaltar. The Conflaris find the Morain an interesting Race, their ability to turn to stone somewhat similar to the Children of Asgar's natural form. It is with the Nemar that the Morain have forged the closest bond however, their island being surrounded by the Shifters territory. Indeed several Morain have been inducted into the Nemar's ongoing war against the Venris further to the south, heading out to spill blood on the battlefields of the southern tip of Toth.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Territory:</strong> Hasch is a dry, arid place with very little water. What little rain does fall typically lands on the eastern side of the landmass, where the only patches of farming land exist and a few isolated communities of Nemar manage to scratch out an existence. The Morain live in scattered tribes amidst the tall stone spires of the desert, hunting for the large lizards and snakes that make this place their home, taking in the little water they require from large, beautifully flowered cacti. Some Morain have moved across the water to the northern tip of Toth which is also a desert area, though less harsh and cooler than vicious Hasch. 

<br /> <br /> <strong>Language:</strong> The Morain have no language of their own and have adopted Nemish as their own, since this was the Race they first encountered. Speaking with Conflaris traders and Ancient DragonLord explorers has spread the use of Common, Conflarian and Draconic amidst the tribes, with some Morain speaking a bizarre mish-mash of all four languages. Most get by in Nemish and Common however.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Names:</strong> Morain favour strong, flint sounding names that best reflect their desert homeland and their own personalities.
