Born of rage and fire, the Ancient DragonLords are the pure-blooded decendents of five thousand DragonLords that travelled South after the end of the Great War. Unsatisfied with the DragonKing's decision to permit humanity to live, Sintai AcidSpitter, First Born Green DragonLord and second eldest of his entire Race, lead his fellow malcontents to establish a new realm. In this aim he was successful, laying claim to three of the islands of the archipelago in the South; Restaril, Nesch and Med. Now the Ancient DragonLords have set their sights upon the East once again, Sintai intending to claim his throne.<br>
<br />
<br /> <strong>Physical Description:</strong> Like all Children of Shaltar, Ancient DragonLords are tall, powerful creatures. Even taller and broader than the average DragonLord, typically exceeding their Eastern breather by a good foot in height, Ancient DragonLords are pure bred down the line from the original five thousand. They possess a triple thickness spinal cord giving superb reaction times, dense muscles and bones, heightened levels of oxygenation in their blood, tough, leather lungs, twin hearts and a reinforced ribcage. All of these things combine to make an Ancient DragonLord a truly formidable physical combatant. When this is added to their heightened regenerative capabilities and a rumoured ability to fully bio-morph into something more than a DragonLord, these creatures are truly terrifying.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Personality:</strong> Normal DragonLords are proud, honourable creatures but their Ancient brethren take that even further. Nearly all of them live by a strict personal code of honour which varies from Breed to Breed. This honour does not prevent them from doing vicious or wicked things for it does not make them good individuals, but it does mean that you can be reasonably certain that an Ancient DragonLord will face you head on and one to one. These rules do not apply when it comes to fighting humans however as the Ancient DragonLords have a deep rooted, inherent hatred of the species. Whilst individuals might overcome their hatred, the entire reason for the march north is to annihilate the humans and claim Sintai's seat upon the throne of the DragonKing.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Religion:</strong> Shaltar is a god of War and Glory and it is in this aspect that the Ancient DragonLords revere him. They love to walk to war, fighting against the Venris to the south, the Nemar and Conflaris to the west and the Sirens to the north. They, like other DragonLords, steadfastly believe that death in battle is absolutely the best way to meet their God and as such they honour such fortunate dead. That isn't to say that the species is suicidal however, since to have glory you also need victory, even if you take victory in death. The Ancient DragonLords, cut off from Shaltar's Temple on the Dragon Isle have set up their own major shine on the island of Restaril, near the Narrows.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Relations:</strong> The Ancient DragonLords have little issue with most of the Races of Tal'Vorn, still remembering them for the honour they displayed during the Great War. However they have issue with a few very specifically. Humanity is a blight upon the world in the eyes of the Ancient DragonLords and they fully intend to whip this plague from the world, taking the human-based Soulless-Born with them. Once that is done Sintai fully intends to have his revenge up on his elder brother, Drake, as well as any DragonLords who might stand with the First Born Black.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Territory:</strong> The Ancient DragonLords have plenty of territory of their own, controlling three of the larger islands in the South. Restaril is the seat of their power, being the largest and possessing the most habitable land. Teeming with forests, the Ancient DragonLord capital city, Sintai's Rest, can be found here as well as a large temple to Shaltar. Nesch is emptier, but is still home to several score of Ancient DragonLord tribes. Med, being primarily mountainous is home to Red, Bronze and Stone DragonLords as well as the city of Tilish.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Language:</strong> Ancient DragonLords typically refuse to speak Common, much preferring to use Draconic, even when talking to members of other race, their pride full expecting the others to have learned the DragonLord language already. If forced to they will speak Common but it is evident when they do that it is distasteful.

<br /> <br /> <strong>Names:</strong>Ancient DragonLords favour the same names as their cousins in the East.

<br /> <br /> <em>You are no DragonLord. You are a weak pup who has allowed his blood to become thin and watery over the years. We will destroy you simply because we are what you aspire to be and can never achieve.</em><br />

<br /> <em>I am the rightful DragonKing. I will reclaim what is mine and slaughter any who stand against me.</em><br />
