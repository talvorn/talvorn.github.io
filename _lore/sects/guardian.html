<br>
<font face="times new roman">Spells normally range from Guardian
Gate to Magic Missile, as well as a learned ability to recognize
spells from other Sects. The Guardians are also expert wall breakers,
generally called in when a group of opponents is within a fortified
location. Using their magics, the Guardians can cause the very walls to
rip themselves asunder. They tend more towards defensive then offensive
spells, though they are more then capable of handling themselves in a
fight.<br>
<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Guardian Magic is a method
for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own
Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too
powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to weild.</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Flay</b><br>

<i>Utilizing the heaviest form of Guardian Magic, the caster tears the
flesh, and muscle from his enemies' bones, all the while keeping them
alive during the process. Immense pain is felt during this time, as the
nerves and brain are the last things to be destroyed. The end effect is
quite lethal; death by either exsanguination, or the utter ruin of all
bodily functions and systems.</i><br></li><li> <b>Hevar's Word</b><br>

<i>Calling on the most potent form of Guardian Magic, the caster tears
down any Fortification made of stone or steel by uttering a single,
whispered word. This spell is miraculous to behold in action, as it
seems that the very structure is ripping itself apart.</i></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Guardians are the protectors of the Magus Council and the guards of
the human cities. There are many of them and their opinion in Council
matters is generally the deciding factor. They are not outside of the
jurisdiction of the Order however and still must obey the laws of the
city.<br>
<br>
The Sect gets on well with most of the other groups, having particular
links to both the Fire and Earth Sects. Indeed when one of these three
Sects makes a vote, it is almost a given that the other two will
support it. Such selective politics is typical of the Magus Council
however and is of little consequence as each Sect Lord or Lady has
their own agenda in the grand scheme of things.<br>
<br>
The Most used Symbol for the Guardian Sect is a great Iron Gate,
however, other Symbols have been used, such as the Stone Tower and the
Steel Shield. The Iron Gate is meant to Symbolize the magics of the
Guardian Sect, and their duty to guard the Magus Council, while the
Stone Tower and Steel Shield are meant to represent their steadfast
resolve and their duty to protect the people, respectively.<br>

<br>
The Current Lord Guardian is Robert LightBringer, also the Lord Magus of the Magus Council.<br>
