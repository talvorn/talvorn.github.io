<font face="times new roman">Focusing upon the icy grasp of
winter and the chill of snow, Ice Magic is a powerful, if somewhat
limited, form of magic. It is at it's strongest in the north and in
areas of high water content, and at it's weakest in the deep deserts
and hot jungles, which would explain why the Ice Sect has it's
headquarters in the port city of Grath rather then the desert bound
Vorn or the jungle drowned Karamaterra.<br>
<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Ice Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Force of Ice</b><br>
<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster launches a blue orb of
shimmering light which causes immediate freezing to any organic
creature it touches. Being hit by the Force of Ice is almost always
instant death; it freezes the blood in your veins, and inadvertently
causes your limbs to break off, as you spasm against tissue frozen
solid and fragile. After such an impact occurs, the orb continues
moving; allowing it to strike multiple targets.</i><br></li><li> <b>Kiss of Winter</b><br>

<i>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster immediately drops the
temperature of the surrounding environment to eighty below zero; far
past freezing point. Anything caught within this cold that is not
protected by powerful magic, or is not a member of the Ice Sect
themselves, will die by frostbite and the freezing of their blood.</i></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Sect of Ice is a branch, originally, of the Water Sect, though they
have since developed their skills and their Magics to the point at
which they can be classed as totally separate from the Water Sect.<br>

<br>
The Ice Sect is generally looked down upon by the other Sects due to
their lack of numbers and relative inexperience compared to the other
Sects. The Lady Ice on the other hand is a ferocious personality, and
determined to foster her own Sect's power. Because of this the Ice Sect
is perhaps the most allied and the least trusted at the moment, for the
Lady Ice has a habit of simply switching sides in any debate to the one
that favours her own Sect most.<br>
<br>
The Symbol of the Ice Sect is a Falling Snowflake.<br>
<br>
The Current Lady Ice is Alicia FrostFormer.<br>
