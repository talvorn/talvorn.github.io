<font size="4"><font face="times new roman"><b><i>Magic Information</i></b></font></font><br>
<br>
<font face="times new roman">The Healer Sect is relatively
straight-forward. Utilizing magic specifically aimed at healing, it is
the power of the Healing Sect to mend wounds, and help the sick. It is
not beyond a Healer's power to seal wounds, regrow limbs, or even cure
disease, sickness, and stave off death. <br>
<br>
Being what they are, all Healers tend to be immune to most illness and
plague, though there are noticeable differences such as the Red Pox, a
contagion crafted by the Corrupter himself, and some very rare jungle
poisons. And even then, what would kill a normal person will just tend
to make a Healer feel a bit drowsy and sick.<br>
</font><blockquote><font face="times new roman"><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Even Healing Magic is a
method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's
own Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are
too powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote><ul><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Regeneration</b><br>

<i>Akin to, but far, far more powerful than the DragonLords' ability to
heal themselves, the Regeneration Spell instantly heals any wounds
sustained for a limited amount of time. The time with which this
spell lasts is directly proportional to how much Mani is used in it's
casting.</i><br></font></li><li><font face="times new roman"> <b>Immortality</b><br>

<i>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster utilizes the Surrounding
Mani to protect himself. So powerful is this spell, the Mage
temporarily becomes nearly invincible. Arrows ricochet off his flesh,
and blades dent on impact. The elements have no effect
on someone imbued with this power, either. This only lasts a short
while, however.</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><font face="times new roman"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Healers, as a Sect, foster deliberately good relations with the
others, with the exception of the Dark Sect. Though no true Healer
would refuse even a Dark Wizards plea for aid, they do not go out of
their way to assist them in the same manner that they would with the
other Sects.<br>
<br>
The Symbol for the Healer Sect is the Red Crucifix of Lady Javersith.<br>
