Sect has it's roots in the skies beyond Tal'Vorn. The Magic of the
Stars, one might say. Capable of creating light, and manipulating
astral bodies such as comets, the Universe sect is also capable of altering the very fundemental aspects of luck and of scrying into future and current events and locations.<br /> </font>
    <blockquote><font face="times new roman"><font color="red"><strong>Forbidden Magic</strong></font><br />
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Universe Magic is a method
for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own
Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too
powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote>

      <li><font face="times new roman"> <strong>Armageddon</strong><br /> <em>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster Summons an asteroid the
size of a small moon, which then proceeds to collide with Tal'Vorn's
surface at the location of the Caster's wish. Naturally, this causes
destruction on a massive scale.</em><br /></font></li>
      <li><font face="times new roman"> <strong>Force of Universe</strong><br /> <em>Calling on this Forbidden Spell, the Caster utilizes the Surrounding
Mani to create a large orb of Celestial light which ricochets off
anything it contacts. Any organic tissue touched by this orb is
instantly incinerated by it's heat.</em></font></li>
    </ul><br/><font face="times new roman"><strong><em><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></em></strong><br /> <br />
The Universe Sect receives little to no respect from most other Casters,
most of them viewing the Universe Casters as pointless stargazers. They
would be hard pressed to rival the power of the Universe Sects
Forbidden Magics however. Spells such as Meteor Rain and Star Dust tend
to do a good deal of damage over a wide area.<br /> <br />
The Universe Sect does, however, have good relations with the
Guardians, Healers and Research Sect, for protection, fellowship and
resources and to offer their own abilities, to predict the coming of
celestial events which might effect the Mani. Indeed it is well
documented for passing comets to pull the Mani away from certain areas,
leaving the place devoid of any sort of Magic.<br /> <br />
The Symbol of the Universe Sect is the Comet.<br />
The current Lord Universe is Fenris Sunbane of Vorstern.<br /> <br />
Due to Solar's affiliation with the Stars, he is a Central God to the Universe Sect.<br /> <br /> <strong>General Allies</strong>: <em>Healer, Guardian, Research, Psychic</em><br /> <strong>General Hostilities</strong>: <em>No open hostilities</em><br /> <strong>Main Goals of the Universe Sect</strong>:</font><font face="times new roman"><strong>-</strong> Increase it's Power Base<br /> <strong>-</strong> Increase it's knowledge.</font> </center></body>
