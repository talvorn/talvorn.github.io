Dark Magic is the magic of the Dark God, the Corrupter and the
spells live up to this legacy, causing horrific pain and terrible
wounds to as many people as possible. In some ways it could be called a
perfect aggressive magic, yet the price you must pay for such power is
steep indeed. The Dark God Himself grants this magic and thus to gain
it you must bargain with Him and the Corrupter is rarely satisfied
with anything less then the Casters immortal soul. Though this may
seem a none existence price to some Humans, it is very much real for the
Elder Races, which perhaps explains why so many of the Dark Magic
users are human.<br>
<br>
Dark Magic spells take the appearance of either crackling black gouts
of energy, or have no appearance at all, leaving simply their effects
behind them. Generally this breed of magic focuses upon the pain or
death of the victim through rot, decay or disease. Spells such as Dark
Bolt, a slow drifting orb of pure decay, rot the flesh, blood and bone
from the body, so that only immediate amputation can save the victims
life. Torment wrack's the body with pain as every nerve ending in the
victim is instantly seemingly set aflame. To cast such spells you must
be powerful within the Dark Sect and yet such power can be quickly
obtained for those willing to take the risks.<br>

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Dark Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield. </blockquote>

<ul><li> <b>Dark Bolt</b><br>
<i>Utilizing this Forbidden Spell, the Caster summons into existence a bolt of black energy that slowly drifts towards the target. Should it hit, then the afflicted will begin to rot from the point of impact. Nothing can stop it's progress, bar immediate removal of the damaged tissue. Using Dark Bolt warrants a life-term in a Torment Engine, no parole.</i><br></li><li> 

<b>Puppet Master</b><br>
<i>This spell simply and effectively removes the victims connection from his brain to his body. In essence it allows the caster to control the victims every move. However, the caster does not gain permanent control over the victim and the spell is cancelled should the caster move out of range, or run out of Mani.</i></li></ul>

<b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
The Dark Sect maintains itself through the rule of the strong. Knowing
that unless they work together they are going to be eliminated by Order
task-forces, the Dark Magic users are forced to stand together,
generally against their will. Thus to determine who will give the
commands and to cull the sheer level of infighting within the Sect, the
strongest rule through simply killing anyone who opposes them. At first
glance this seems a chaotic and illogical system until you realize that
everyone who uses Dark Magic is worried first and foremost about
staying alive to increase their own power and are thus unlikely to take
the immense risks inherent in attacking a more powerful Dark Caster. 
Indeed even someone technically weaker then themselves could slip
past a dangerous spell or two and with Dark Magic one or two spells can
be enough to fatally end a fight.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Symbol of Dark Magic is a Black Skull.<br>
<br>
The leader of the Dark Sect is unknown. However the most powerful Dark Wizard at large today, and the self-proclaimed Lord Dark is Vardar GuardianSlayer.<br>
