High Technology includes the following non-exclusive list;<br><br>

1. PTAU's (Personal Tactical Assault Units) - A exo-skeleton designed to house one standard sized humanoid. Approximately eight feet tall, bipedal and complete with ONE of the following weapons: Assault Cannon, Ion Cannon or Flamethrower. Can run for 72 hours before needing to be recharged with either a Fusion Charger, or a Lightning spell.<br><br>

2. Ion Cannons - An eight foot long cannon, that fires  man-sized bolts of energised plasma. Can be fired 10 times before it requires reloading, using a Fusion Charger or a Universe Spell. Can be used as a ranged weapon only on the ground or in the hands of an Anvar.<br><br>

3. Rail Driver - A twelve foot long weapon, that fires super-accelerated slugs of metal at hyper velocities. Takes five minutes to recharge between shots. The slug is the size of a man's fingernail, but will punch a fist sized hole through anything it impacts with. The slug itself won't stop for about a mile.<br><br>

4. Assault Cannons - A heavy gatling cannon, suitable to be mounted on a PTAU, a turret or carried as a ranged weapon by an Anvar. Chain feeds from a large bullet silo stored nearby. Fires 3000 rounds a minute. Bullets are the length of a man's hand. Full discharge of the silo occurs in ten minutes.<br><br>

5. Laser Rifles - Fires a small bolt of magnetically sealed energy. Does comparable damage to that of a standard bullet from a Dwarf Handgun. Can fire 50 shots before needing to be reloaded. Cartridge can be reloaded from a Fusion Charger or through a Fire or Light spell.<br><br>

6. Flamethrower - Unleashes a gush of burning liquid over a large area, which melts and burns flesh. On full fire, the canister will empty in five minutes. Reloading method unknown.<br><br>

7. Mass Driver - A smaller, hand-held, weaker version of the Rail Driver, the Mass Driver fires a slug of similar size, but has a range of only a few feet before the energy behind the slug fades. Three minute reload time.<br><br>

8. Fusion Charger - A man-sized fusion generator, this allows the recharging of most High Technology weapons and is a smaller version of a colony ships engine. As a fusion generator it is self-sustaining, but if damaged could explode in a truly violent manner.<br><br>

Any High Technology must be found as the result of quest. KEEPING any High Technology found on said quests is at the sole discretion of the judging Mod. Appealing to a Smod or higher will NOT change the results of the judging.
