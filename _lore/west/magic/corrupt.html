<hr /><br><Br><Br>



Corrupt Magic is a degenerate, decaying, rotting force, with its roots firmly in Dark Magic. Developed by the Southar from basic Torma Dark Magic, Corrupt spells do simply that. They corrupt. Be it rusting metal, or rotting wood, or even causing illness to ravage the flesh of living beings, Corrupt Magic is vile and difficult to stop. It is capable of devouring its way through even the most powerful of defensive spells, though Guardian Magic, due to it's basis as a Hevar magic, is capable of slowing the effects of Corrupt spells. Armour, walls, spells or even distance are little defense against the power of Corrupt Magic. The only thing that can save you is either divine intervention, or the stoutest of hearts and the toughest of bodies.<br>

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Corrupt Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to weild. However, Corrupt Magic is not a Magus Council approved spell group, and never was. As such any of it's spells contained within the Magus Council facilities are there purely for purposes of research.</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Dissolve</b><br>

<i>This spells power is such that anything it strikes instantly begins to liquify. The only exceptions to this would be granite and Old Metal, the outer hull layers taken from the human colony ships. It's effects are, naturally, horrific and typically lethal. It shares a common bond with the Dark Bolt in that cutting away the damaged area will prevent further infection. However, unlike Dark Bolt, the spell takes the form of a simple beam of energy that travels very quickly. Yet once struck, the victim will often remain alive for several minutes, unlike the far swifter acting Dark Bolt.</i><br></li><li> <b>Plague</b><br>

<i>This spell unleashes on of the Dark God's favourite poxes upon the effected, an effect which is generally lethal. However, under the effects of the Plague spells, the pox becomes high contagious, spreading through the population like wildfire.</i></li></ul>

Corrupt Magic is the creation of the Southar Humans and as such is typically used in support of their Beast and Torma allies. Indeed one of the favourite tricks of a Southar Sorcerer is to join forces with a Torma Pack Magic user. The Torma takes control of an animal, the Southar infects the creature with a Corrupt spell and then the animal is compelled by the Torma to move near enough the target to infect him. All without any risk to the casters.<br>

<br>
In reccnt times .Corrupt Mages have been spotted on the Tal'Vorn mainlands, as far East as Vorn City. This is, to the Magus Council, an unacceptable trend, and they are doing everything in their power to halt the flow of casters. It's bad enough that Dark Mages and various lethal Races are abroad on Tal'Vorn without adding Corrupt Magic to the equation.<br>
<br>
The Symbol of Corrupt Magic is a Broken Skull.<br>
