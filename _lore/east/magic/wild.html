<br>
An uncontrolled magic, violent and
destructive, an explosive form of magic that manifests itself in
flowing beams and pulsing balls of light, the very raw stuff of spells
themselves. Naturally this sort of magic is not exactly well suited for
anything needing precision or any sort of defence, but for sheer
offensive power in a raw blast combined with speed of casting it cannot
be matched.<br>
</font><blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Wild Magic is a method for
incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden
Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful
for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield.</font></blockquote><ul><li> <b>End</b><br>

<i>Utilizing the strongest burst of Wild Magic possible without
devastating their own body, the DragonLord lets loose a strike of
destruction powerful enough to bring utter ruin to a full sized
mountain.</i></font></li></ul><hr color="#000000" size="1"><b><i><font size="4">Sect Political Information</font></i></b><br>
<br>
Wild Magic has been in use by the DragonLords since they came to
Tal'Vorn. Indeed the magic itself is so very in-tune with the race that
it is almost unheard of for any DragonLord to not at least know the
bare theory of Wild Magic, even if they choose to focus their skills
elsewhere.<br>

<br>
Curiously, however, the Eldest DragonLord, Drake FrostHeart, is only
slightly skilled with Wild Magic, preferring to use his Order Spells or
simply brute force instead. The most skilled Wild Mage at the moment is
a DragonLady known as Isabella BlindingStrike. She is well versed in
all forms of Wild Magic and is well capable of levelling buildings with
a single focused unleashing of energy. Indeed such is her power that
the DragonKing, Vralic BlackDragon himself, allows her to lead his
armies in his absence, trusting to both her power and her wisdom,
wisdom being a rare commodity in the fiery DragonLords, to lead
responsibly.<br>
<br>
Wild Casters are not known for their ability to work well with others,
though how much of this is due to the Magic itself or the DragonLords
that invariably cast it, is unknown.<br>
<br>
The Current Lady Wild, if she could be considered to lead a non-existent Sect, is Isaballa BlindingStrike.</font>
