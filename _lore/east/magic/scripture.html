Formed of the innate power of words, rather then the false
illusions of the Mani, Scripture Magic is the Magic of the Lar'K'Leth.
Incorporating specific vocal sounds, hand motions and body postures, it
is a difficult magic to cast, to summon and to bind. Yet it is also the
most powerful magic for crafting artefacts. Because Scripture Runes do not
lose their power, even if all the Mani in an area are wiped out, they
can be used in any situation and are far more reliable then simply
hoping that the local population of microscopic illusion makers is high
enough for your spell casting needs!<br>
<br>
Indeed the only surviving Lar'K'Lath city, Lara, is protected by the
most powerful set of defensive spells ever brought together in one
place. Scriptures to destroy Mani, to detect invading armies, to
destroy offensive weapons, everything that the dying race need to
defend themselves against the overwhelming forces ranged against the
Lar'K'Leth.<br>
<br>
Scripture Magic, outside of Lara, is normally weaker then normal Mani
based Magic, yet is more varied. Whilst a Fire Mage and a Blood Mage
would only be able to cast Fire and Blood spells respectively, the
Lar'K'Leth scriptures can cause flames to erupt, the temperature to
drop, the ground to shake. Thus Scripture Magic is the weakest but at
the same time the most versatile of all Magics.<br>
<br>
It is restricted to Lar'K'Leth use only, as the First Born won't educate any others 
in its usage, so filled with hate are they. However a small group of Lar'K'Leth in Vorn 
City regularly sells rune-marked items for exorbitant prices to the hated foe.<br>
