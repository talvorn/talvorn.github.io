<hr /><br><Br><Br>

Forbidden Magic is every spell ever crafted that the Magus Council
have deemed to powerful to be permitted. The incantations are
transcribed by mind wiped slaves under the scrutiny of the Lord
DarkSide and then locked in the great Vault under the Research
Sect Headquarters. The vault is protected by some of the most powerful
defensive Wards in Vorn City, even stronger then those that protect the
Magus Council themselves, and for good reason. <br>
<br>
The spells contained within the Vault could destroy the entire planet.
Spells like Ragnorok which change every living thing into a destructive
berserker, Apocalypse which destroys every Mani on Tal'Vorn, Divine Word
which, when spoken, kills everything within ear-shot, the caster
included. Such spells were crafted in the time after Magic was
discovered, the newly formed Research Sect pushing the bounds of what
could be done further and further back until they finally reached
levels too dangerous to even cast under controlled circumstances.<br>
<br>
And yet not all of these spells are totally banned. Each Sect has
access to just two Forbidden Spells that were granted to them by the
Magus Council, against the wishes of both the Research Sect and the
DarkSiders. Unfortunately this occurred before the Dark Sect was riven
from the rest of the Council and so they too have access to a pair of
Forbidden Spells, the infamous Dark Bolt which dissolves the flesh of
living creatures and cannot be healed or regenerated leaving amputation
the only option and the equally brutal Puppet Master which allows the
Dark Caster to control the actions of another. These spells are just a
taster of the horror that would occur should the Vault ever be breached
. . .
