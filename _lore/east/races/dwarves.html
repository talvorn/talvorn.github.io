It is said that the Dwarves are greedy, that they
desire nothing more then material wealth, be it in
gold, jewels, steel or ilthin. That they can sniff it
out where it lies, that they will kill or murder just
for a few precious nuggets of gold. Though yes it
is true that they love gold and will hoard it away
from all others, no Dwarf will kill for it, unless
the stuff is taken from him by some lesser
creature. It is this desire for wealth that drives the
Dwarves and what makes them who they are.

<b>Physical Description:</b> Short and broad, Dwarves seem built for their mountain homes. With arms as thick as a man's thighs, their strength and endurance are both excellent. This coupled with the Dwarfs natural stubbornness can make the short warriors surprisingly hard to bring down in combat. Their flesh is normally a dark tone, the colour of earth or soil, though some Dwarves have almost human tones to their skin. They grow facial hair almost religiously, keeping and maintaining their beards as a sign of their rank and status. Indeed, the longer a Dwarfs beard the more respect he is granted. Yet only once it touches the floor is a Dwarf given the highly prestigious title of Hazzthrek, meaning literally Long Beard. Their beards start dark and pale as they age; through they continue to grow until the day the Dwarf dies. Female Dwarves do not grow beards. They do, however, perform the same duties as the male Dwarves, mining, stone working, weapon crafting, selling wares and looking after the mine animals. The Dwarves do not permit their women to go to war however, drawing the line at sending their daughters and wives deliberately into harms way. Normally shorter and not quite so broad as the male Dwarves, the female Dwarves, having no beards, take great pride in their hair instead, some spending hours plaiting and weaving it into intricate shapes.

<b>Personality:</b> Dwarves are stubborn beyond
common sense, preferring to cling to an incorrect
argument, no matter how clearly it is wrong,
rather then concede the point to their opponent.
This passes over into their common lives, making
each Dwarf driven by honour, desiring to fulfil
their word as if they have no other choice. If a
Dwarf says that he will do something, then
nothing short of an army standing in his way will
stop him. And only then once, they have hacked
the Dwarf to death. Dwarves are tenacious in
defence and nigh unstoppable on the attack, their
sheer willpower allowing them to face against
foes that outstrip them, or numbers far greater
then anyone should sensibly face.
<br>
<br>
Yet hand in hand with honour and bullheadedness comes pride and pride may, other then greed, be the Dwarves primary downfall. Though they will keep their word if they can, they are bound to redeem themselves if, for some reason, they are forced to break their oath. They hold words, promises, and oaths above even gold, holding honour in almost as high a regard, believing that one without honour is one without a point to their life. Unfortunately, there are many cases of a Dwarf being simply unable to fulfil an oath, protect his family or pay a debt. This results in the Dwarf shaving his head, giving his possessions to his family, or the Dwarf High King
if his family are dead, and then seeking out the
largest monster he can find, to seek out
redemption in death.

<br>
<b>Religion:</b> Dwarves love both metal and ale with a deep fervour, yet this is in its turn exceeded by their devotion to Terra. Everyday Drazzahezz rings with the deep voices of the Dwarves, their songs sung in praise of the Earth Master, in devotion to the God of Metal and Stone. They loathe war and yet love it, hating that Dwarves must die because of it and yet glorifying the honour and courage displayed by their people in the defence of Drazzahezz. It is in glorious battle that the Dwarves honour their God, striving to show that they are worthy of the effort Terra
undertook to create them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Relations:</b> Dwarves get on well with most of the Races, though there are notable exceptions.
Anvar, being the Eaters of Metal, have always
been in competition with the Dwarves for
resources and this rivalry has more then once
spilled over into war. The Elves find the Dwarven
city, Drazzahezz, abhorrent, being used to the
open spaces of the forests, but they have no issue
with the Dwarves themselves.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Territory:</b> The Dwarves are found in most of the human cities, having dedicated quarters in the
larger two, Grath and Vorn. However, their largest
population is in their two cities, the mountain
Drazzahezz and the orbiting planet Dragons Eye.
Dwarves and Ether Walkers crafted a Jump Gate
to Dragons Eye and there built a small city to
mine the planetoids precious iron. It is from here
that most of Tal'Vorn's weapons come from,
forged from the red rock of the moon.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Language:</b> Dwarves are very cautious with the spoken form of their language. Though they have no issue in speaking it in front of strangers, they are loathe to deliberately teach it. The written form, however, is very common, often used as a form of decoration on Dwarven goods.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Names:</b> Dwarven names are like the people,
blunt and to the point. Though not so brief as
Anvar names, they still favour shorter and less
complex references to themselves. For example:
Male: 'ki, Egil, Finnr, R'g, Snorri, V�li
Female: Auda, Hildr, Ingrid, Nessa, Sif, Vald�s.
