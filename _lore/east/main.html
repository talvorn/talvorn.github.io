True Freedom In A World That Alters All Around You<Br>
The Ability To Explore The Boundaries Of Your Skill As A Roleplayer<Br>
An Immense World With Billions Of Inhabitants<Br>
A Character Driven Judging System That Rewards You For Living Rather Then Just Fighting<Br><Br>
<Br><Br>
When darkness o'erwhelms the land,<Br>
When seas run red and rivers boil,<Br>
Seek out now, to save thy souls,<Br>
The ones of legend, of strength and power,<Br>
The immortal ones reborn once more,<Br>
To walk Tal'Vorn in mortal form.<Br>
<Br><Br>
The hybrid-breed, the gleaming knight,<Br>
Soulless-Born and lacking sight.<Br>
<Br><Br>
The russet-haired, pale-fleshed slayer,<Br>
And every kill her own bloody prayer.<Br>
<Br><Br>
The undying lady,yet cannot kill,<Br>
Always fearless yet fearing still.<Br>
<Br><br>
Youth and age, both through currents steer,<Br>
Beauty and wisdom that Time holds dear.<Br>
<Br><br>
The Dragons daughter, AllFather belov√©d,<Br>
Heart of fire and by Or mothered.<Br>
<br><br>
A Striken melody so sweetly played,<Br>
A mismatched gaze and a raven blade.<Br>
<Br><Br>
A soothing Fae of burgeoning skill,<br>
Loves all that lives and will not kill.<br>
<br><br>
The exiled air-walker who still can fly,<br>
Twinned forms of cat and child of sky.<br>
<br><br>

<br>
And the search for the Twelve continues . . . .<Br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Tal'Vorn. Welcome to the World.
