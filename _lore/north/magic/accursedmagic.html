Though similar in the basic capabilities to Bone Magic, the Magic of the Accurséd is steeped in something more disturbing. Whilst Bone Magic, even at its most twisted, persuades the Dead to Wake, Accurséd Magic does no such thing, ripping the Sleeping Dead from their slumber and binding them to the will of the Caster. As such, you can control much larger groups of Woken Dead with Accurséd Magic, but they do not serve willingly. Indeed should your hold over them be broken, then your very life and soul would be placed in great danger by their wrath. Not only that, but Accurséd Magic uses the very essence of the Accurséd themselves, blighting and bewitching the victims of it's spells, inflicting upon them the many and varied nuances of Illaria's insanity.

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Accurséd Magic is a method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield. However, Accurséd Magic is not a Magus Council approved spell group, and never was. As such any of it's spells contained within the Magus Council facilities are there purely for purposes of research.


</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Raise Horde</b><br>
<i>Utilising this Forbidden Spell, the Caster forces every Sleeping corpse within a five mile radius to stagger upright under the control of the Caster. Though the distance sounds small, on Tal'Vorn where virtually every inch of the land is soaked in the blood of generations of conflict, this is a staggering number of Woken Dead. However, this is a difficult spell to cast, and as such must be maintained at all times. Should the Casters concentration be broken by trying to Cast another spell, then Raise Horde will automatically fail, the Dead collapsing back into Sleep.</i><br></li>

<li> <b>Illaria's Curse</b><br>

<i>A vile gesture and a word that has no right to exist in this dimension causes the victim's very mental balance to be thrown away. They descend into a gibbering shell of the person they had once been, unable to reason, speak or move of their own will. It is difficult to reverse, requiring Psychic Magics of the most powerful sort something only a Mistress of Master of the highest calibre could achieve.</i></li></ul>

<br>
Accurséd Magic is the vile monster crafted by Illaria, a Goddess with no remorse and no conscience. As such, Accurséd Magic has no allies, it's very presence crafted by creatures born of pure insanity, in some cases even more crazed then the worst of Demons and more depraved then the vilest Pravaii. Any Accurséd would rather kill all other creatures then work beside them, and the Magic follows this same trend, having no capability of determining between friend and foe. Several of its spells simply attack the nearest living thing that is not the Caster. Because of the this, they do not even work with such Magics as Corrupt, Dark, Blood or Pack, choosing to stand alone instead.<br>

<br>
The Symbol of Accurséd Magic is the Everchanging Rune.<br>
<br>
The most powerful Accurséd Magic user currently alive is Ilgrim VileWord.<br>
