Bone Magic is the form of casting used by the Mortis to Wake and Rest the Dead. Though it is most famous for the Twelve Commands that form its core, this is not everything the magic involves. It is able to create walls and shields of calcified rock, cause the ground to erupt with spears of bone to pierce and strike an opponent and is able to directly damage the skeleton of another Caster, without having to go through the outer skin and flesh. However, it can also bind and repair wounds, heal the sick and dying, and comfort the doomed on to their final sleep.

<blockquote><font color="red"><b>Forbidden Magic</b></font><br>
Like all of the Recognized Forms of Magic, Bone Magic is a method for incredibly powerful spells to be cast, and thus, has it's own Forbidden Magic. Locked away by the Magus Council, these Spells are too powerful for any but the most stalwart of heroes to wield. However, Bone Magic is not a Magus Council approved spell group, and never was. As such any of it's spells contained within the Magus Council facilities are there purely for purposes of research.


</blockquote><ul><li> <b>Raise Mortalis</b><br>
<i>Utilising this Forbidden Spell, the Caster summons into existence a creature called a Mortalis. Made of grave dirt, bone and blood, whilst in contact with the ground, a Mortalis is unkillable. It takes its strength from the soil, able to increase its body size or stretch its limbs at will. Though incapable of magic, a Mortalis is a powerful and dangerous Woken Dead.</i><br></li>

<li> <b>Snap</b><br>

<i>Though the name sounds simple and unassuming, the effects are not to be denied. A bone in the victims body simply factures into two. And then the bones in contact with it do the same. And then the bones in contact with those do so as well, a continuing spiral until every bone in the victims body is a snapped mass and the victim is nothing more then a wet pile of mewling flesh on the floor.</i></li></ul>

<br>
Bone Magic is the creation of Zarner, granted to the Mortis by the God of the Dead. However, in spite of the Gods noble intentions, the magic is still, simply put, Necromancy. As such it has links to Life Magic, though that Sect would never admit it, and the Blood Magic of the Pravaii, especially in both types of Magic being able to summon the horrendously powerful Mortalis, albeit at a greater physical cost for a Pravaii, though the damage to a Mortis' soul should not be overlooked.<br>

The Symbol of Bone Magic is a Gravestone.<br>
