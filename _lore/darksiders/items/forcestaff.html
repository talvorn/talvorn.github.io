<h2>Force Staff/Baton</h2>
<hr />
<p>
    The force staff Darksiders idea of a non-lethal weapon, it comes in several sizes from a small batton up to a full
    sized staff. A few prototype retractable versions also exist. It is a fairly standard weapon forged from a variety
    of materials but features a blitz ball core in one end. This core is configured to cast a single spell a few dozen
    times at low power before it is depleted. As well as ensuring that a staff will last a full fight, the low power is
    intended to disable rather than kill a target. The usual choices of stored spells are stunning spells, psychic blast
    and other similar spells. Like the ring it can be recharged rapidly with a charger or slowly as a self charge. These
    weapons are also supplied to Order mages, guardian mages and the members of the warrior guild charged with
    security in Tal hill.
