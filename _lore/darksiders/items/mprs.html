<h2>Multi Person Relocation System</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    Teleportation by magic is an inherently risky way to travel and requires a lot of concentration and energy expenditure
    by the teleportee to avoid pitfalls such as teleporting yourself directly into solid rock or 100s of meters above the
    ground. It is definitely not a good way to get elite troops into and out of combat situations and so when the research
    sect first unveiled the multi person relocation system it was seized upon by the Order and Darksiders, even though the
    first systems could only scale to two people with a range not even sufficient to cover the whole of Vorn city.
</p>

<p>
    Not long after the Research sect began to produce the devices en-masse for the Order the two mages who were responsible
    for developing it disappeared - although never seen in public again it is accepted as fact that they were recruited as
    Darksiders and tasked with developing far better versions of their device solely for use by the Darksiders. No one is
    entirely sure of the specifications of the devices used by the Darksiders but from observable data it is known that they
    can send at least 8 people at once and cover distances previously only possible by jump gate.
</p>

<p>
    The device works in much the same way as a jump gate, but doesn't require a gate at both ends. Instead, a closed loop
    is formed between the device and the intended destination with an equal volume of matter to the teleportee captured at
    the destination site. This matter and the teleportee are then sent around the loop, once the matter reaches the device
    the loop is colapsed; depositing the teleportee at the destination and the capture matter inside the device with a loud
    <b>CRACK</b>. This gives rise to an informal slang used by Darksiders: cracking.
</p>

<p>
    Of the known limitations of the device targeting is the main downside and is one of the major roadblocks to increasing
    range. It also means that all the users of a single device need to be sent through very close to each other, practically
    this means that it is preferred to target outdoor areas and open spaces where there is a bit of room for error.
    The Darksiders are known to use Psychic magic along with their comms devices to help with targeting, especially for
    the return journey where accuracy is far more important - no-one wants to leave a leg behind! The cycle time of the
    version used by the Order is a little under half an hour, however the Darksider version can recharge in as little as
    a minute if the destination is near-by
