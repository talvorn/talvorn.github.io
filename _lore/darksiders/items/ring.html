<h2>Darksiders Ring</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    A ring worn by most Darksiders which is used as a weapon of last resort, concealed on their person with powerful
    charms; the ring uses the same technology as a Blitz ball to provide a number of emergency casts of a single spell.
    It can be recharged quickly with a special charging device present in all Darksider bases, otherwise will take
    around a day to self charge back to full power.
