<h2>Portable Refraction Shield</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    Not a unique technology to the Darksiders, however teams will usually carry several portable refraction shields
    capable of creating either a shield dome or shield wall in a stationary location. The devices usually provide enough
    power to run in standby mode for about a day, the lifetime of the device when under attack is proportional to the
    strength of the attacks used against it.

    Portable refraction shields are generally stronger than personal refraction shields, but not as strong as the shields
    used on machines and buildings. Most are unable to self charge but can be recharged even after the shield has depleted
    completely using a suitable charging device.
