<h2>Blast/Blitz Balls</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    The technology that powers Blitz balls is at the heart of a lot of Darksiders technology; developed due to a need to
    give Darksiders rapid access to the most powerful spells from other sects. The common design features a spell in
    suspended animation as well as enough stored energy to power it. In the case of a blast ball this is an explosive
    spell, usually from the fire, psychic or air sects. The device is optimised to provide a lot of energy very rapidly
    to devastating effect. A blitz ball is a slightly more complex design that allows for a far greater range of stored
    spells with the trade off of lower energy available for casting them. Advanced users will often carry unprimed
    blitz balls and cast a spell into them based on their current needs, lower level casters will usually carry an
    assortment of utility spells from sects outside their current knowledge.

    The balls themselves are about an inch in diameter and when activated swell to three times this size. Upon activation
    the user can select from a number of different detonation styles - timed, impact, proximity and set the device.
    Once activated it cannot be returned to a deactivated state but can be disarmed. If left in an active state for too
    long the power cell will eventually drain leaving the device harmless.

    In general, balls are single use and cannot be recharged, however a number of prototype devices exist which
    aim to provide ongoing power to fuel spells of longer duration which can be recharged while in use. The technology
    which powers these prototypes is considered too valuable to use in single use devices so very few of them have been
    made.
