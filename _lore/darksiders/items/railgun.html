<h2>Rail Gun</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    The Darksiders' rail guns started out as an attempt to make a smaller Rail driver which could out perform the mass
    driver and would sit in between the two in terms of power. The initial attempts were disappointing, although a
    rifle sized weapon was constructed it's power still paled in comparison to its larger cousin. These did enter service
    and were carried by Darksiders for several years but they lacked in popularity owing to the many drawbacks of the
    technology such as the reload time and the still cumbersome size.

    The breakthrough for this weapon came when it was decided to move away from a pure technological solution. By ditching
    the heavy coils required by the previous iteration it made the gun lighter and smaller. Instead of using these coils
    to accelerate the mass, a variation on the blitz ball core was used although instead of suspending a spell the core
    was used to accelerate it. Stretched into elongated figures of eight, up to 24 cores surround the barrel of the gun.
    When the trigger is pulled, a telekinesis spell is unleashed into all of the cores simultaneously their configuration
    concentrates, amplifies and pulses the spell along the inside of the barrel; rapidly accelerating whatever is inside it.

    The new gun style has many advantages, as well as being smaller and lighter than other similar weapons; it can fire
    any projectile and can be fed from a cartridge making the reload process simple and fast. Unlike it's high technology
    versions, it is unable to fire if the concentration of mani in the area is low and the super acceleration provided by
    the cores rapidly consume mani in the area. While in theory the cartridge fed mechanism would allow you to fire many
    shots per second, in practice the fire rate of the gun is limited by both mani consumption and heat generation to a
    couple of shots per minute, although these could be in rapid succession followed by a longer cooldown period.
