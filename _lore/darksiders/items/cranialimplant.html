<h2>Cranial Communication Implant</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    All Darksiders have a communications implant which is usually placed under the skin of one or both temples. The
    device is small and discreet and serves two main functions 1) the ability to communicate with other Darksiders at close
    range 2) the ability to communicate back to the nearest Darksider base. An auxiliary function allows for a Darksider
    to be accurately located and targeted by an MPRS. The device is protected by concealment charms and incorporates
    several layers of defensive mechanisms to prevent its removal by unauthorised persons.
</p>

<p>
    Communication can be activated by an incoming message or by a single (receive) or double (send) tap. The device
    communicates directly to the users brain and can pick up sound within approximately 1 meter of the user allowing a
    reply. Additionally, Darksiders trained in psychic magic can use telepathy to send a message silently as well as
    being able to recieve messages in this manner.
