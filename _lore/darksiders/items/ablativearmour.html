<h2>Micro-shielded Ablative Armour</h2>
<hr />

<p>
    A Darksider can be equipped with many weapons, all highly dangerous in unskilled hands and exceptionally lethal in
    the hands of a highly skilled Darksider. They can know magics from several sects and be trained in the ways of the
    warrior guild. None of this is as important as being able to survive on a battlefield so it was the breakthrough that
    led to the development of the Darksiders armour was what turned them into an existential threat to the Dark sect.
</p>

<p>
    The research sect have toyed with various designs for ablative armours for centuries; the core idea, an armour that
    sacrifices itself to protect the wearer from otherwise unsurvivable impacts is fairly straight foward and they saw
    some early successes using contact explosives. This armour saw usage on PTAUs and other mechanical constructions
    however this armour wasn't of great use for people - there aren't many people who like walking around in a suit of
    armour which is <b>designed</b> to explode when hit.
</p>

<p>
    Further advancements came through armour which instead of exploding, used various meta materials to convert kinetic
    and other energies from an impact into a different form of energy usually heat or electricity. To avoid cooking or
    electrocuting the wearer this energy had to be dispersed rapidly and this was achieved by having the material itself
    absorb the energy and burn off. This turned out to be much safer for people to wear, but it still didn't see a great
    deal of use - the armour is essentially single use as soon as it took a hit you would need to replace it. This
    maintenance cost limited the armour to being available to only the richest, and they tended to have others to do their
    fighting for them. The situation did improve slightly when developments were made which allowed for the armour to be
    regenerated however the costs for this armour are still outside what most can afford.
</p>

<p>
    Research sect members recruited by the Darksiders have taken the design several steps further to produce the armour
    used by most Darksiders today. Building on the designs which converted to electrical energy the goal was to find
    something else to do with the energy which didn't require burning away the armour itself. Attempts were made to
    try and route the energy to ground; to store it for later use by weapons and even to discharge immediately through a
    weapon. None of these attempts met with much success due to the need to route high levels of energy from the point
    of impact to the point it was to be used, even the armours which succeeded required either thick conduits
    to transfer the power or vast arrays of coolant to stop thinner conduits from instantly melting making them impractical
    for combat use.
</p>

<p>
    The final design settled upon the need to use the generated energy locally to where it was generated. After a few false
    starts trying to create a weapon which could do this, they instead tried using a personal refraction shield. This design
    was iterated on multiple times and examples from each generation are still in use due to the cost of manufacture. They
    range from the first designs using a single refraction shield which gets recharged by impacts on the armour reducing
    the amount of damage to the armour per hit by an order of magnitude, through to the top of the line versions which use
    thousands of miniaturised shields in a grid across the armour which are capable of absorbing practically all the energy
    generated by the armour.
</p>

<p>
    The different versions of the armour have different weaknesses, the initial designs for example made it pretty much
    impossible to cause harm to the wearer until 50% or more of the ablative material had been burned away by energy
    which wasn't used to recharge the PRS, but failed pretty abruptly beyond this point. Later designs which used multiple
    PRSs were better at this as they had a higher energy conversion ratio, however the miniaturised shields couldn't take
    as high a charge rate so a failure could happen if struck with a high energy concentrated attack such as a shot from
    a mass driver. The very cutting edge designs have begun to use energy balancers to share energy with nearby shield units
    to prevent a single unit getting overwhelmed but the effectiveness of this has to be balanced against the need to
    avoid transferring the energy too far and returning to the issues present in the first attempts.
